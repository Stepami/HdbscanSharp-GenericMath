When you apply to job online, do you ever try to connect with a recruiter from that company on LinkedIn?
Assuming you submitted a resume and cover letter. Especially for big companies that have there own job application portal. What exactly do you say in the invite message? Just a quick "Hi I applied for x position mainly because I have experience doing x. Are you interested in taking more"?  submitted by /u/Genoe [link] [comments]
