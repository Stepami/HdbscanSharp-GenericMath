Where to go after 'washing out' of development
What are some jobs that might utilize development skills without being a developer? I don't think I'm being taken seriously as a mid-level candidate but I have no real desire to make anything and post it publicly on GitHub or study CS for whiteboard interviews, so I just want to switch out. Management and leadership is also not really in my blood. Thanks  submitted by /u/formula1duck [link] [comments]
