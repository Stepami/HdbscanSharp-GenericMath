I got into law school for undergrad in the uk because I picked the wrong subjects in high school
I'm in my first month of university. I couldn't get into computer sciencebecause I picked the wrong subjects in high school. I've always enjoyed mathematics and making things hence the reason why I want to go into computrr science. I still want to be a programmer. Is it too late? I hope not but it seems so. I only know very very basic python and HTML/css. How do I still become a software developer? Should I just give up? I will never have a degree in computer science. That would be depressing, but I'm pretty acquainted with reality.  submitted by /u/IncandescentEntrant [link] [comments]
