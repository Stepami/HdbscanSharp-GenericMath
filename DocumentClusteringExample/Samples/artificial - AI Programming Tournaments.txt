AI Programming Tournaments
Hey Everyone, I've recently become really interested in writing engines for games like chess and checkers. I was watching a lecture a few days ago about how AlphaGo works and the lecturer made a comment on a type of competition where some game rules were randomly generated or made up and then people would write their own AIs for that made up game and they would play against each other in a tournament. I haven't been able to find anything on google about these kinds of tournaments, thought someone on this subreddit might have an idea of what he was talking about.  submitted by /u/TimeLoad [link] [comments]
