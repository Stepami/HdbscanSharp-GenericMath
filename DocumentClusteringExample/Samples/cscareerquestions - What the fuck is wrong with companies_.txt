What the fuck is wrong with companies?
Edit: naming and shaming them. The first two were Gate1Travel and WorkWave. The last one I won't name. Edit2: WorkWave's values are "The company looks for employees who have empathy." My ass. 1) Phone screen, on-site. At the on-site, I was shown how I'd be doing my job by the CEO. Months later, no reply, no rejection. 2) Phone interview with engineering director. He said I should be expecting an invite to the on-site. Months later, no reply, no rejection. 3) Most recently, two phone tech interviews. CTO emailed me to schedule a phone call. I emailed back with the times. Two weeks later, no reply confirming a phone call. I can't stand this shit any longer. I don't get how people get jobs so easily. Someone said they just showed up for all of the interviews and instantly got a job every time. Meanwhile, I'm dealing with thousands of applications to companies, followed by all this ghosting crap. There's no logic behind anything.  submitted by /u/recruitingsucks [link] [comments]
