Guidance on New Grad Offers
Hi All, I know questions like these are hard to answer because their very personal so I apologize in advance. Which would be the better option for a new grad? 60k at a midsize bank in KC or 75k at a large defense contractor in Baltimore? Both positions would be "developer programs" where I would rotate between different areas of software development for two years. The midsize bank wants an answer next week while the defense contractor wants an answer by the end of November. Also, I might have something else from another large defense contractor and a large telecommunications company if I wait...I can't say that I feel like I "belong" more at one than the other as I haven't been onsite at the defense contractor. They just required a phone interview while for the bank I had a meeting at a career fair, a phone interview, and then an onsite. My interviewers were really nice onsite but I wasn't able to see/talk with any other developers so I'm kind of uncertain... I'd really appreciate any advice but I understand that it's a question that ultimately nobody can answer but myself. Sorry for the shitpost, but thank you for your time and help! ~ifUwereMe  submitted by /u/ifUwereMe [link] [comments]
