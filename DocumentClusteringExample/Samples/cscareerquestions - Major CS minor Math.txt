Major CS minor Math
Hi guys I did a quick search to see if this question is already here didnt see anything so Im hoping this isnt an issue I want to know the benefits towards one's skills/ability if one was to do a minor in Math along with CS. Would it make them a stronger developer? Thanks  submitted by /u/RedWine32 [link] [comments]
