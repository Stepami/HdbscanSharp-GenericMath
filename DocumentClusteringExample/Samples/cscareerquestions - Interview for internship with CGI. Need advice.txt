Interview for internship with CGI. Need advice
So i landed an interview with cgi from a college career fair and i know they deal a lot with java/javascript. Has anyone had an internship with them, does anybody have any tips on what i should brush up on?  submitted by /u/Throwawayz911 [link] [comments]
