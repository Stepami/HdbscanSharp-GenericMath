Can an AI game playing against itself learn deep strategies?
I read an article about how the Alpha Go Zero learned to become way better than Alpha Go by playing millions of games agains itself. In a game playing against oneself , strategies beyond one step make no sense at all, because now the opponent knows your plans and can in most cases effectively mount a defence. As an example, if I were playing a game of chess against myself, most of the games would end up in a draw. A small number of games would be won by either sides. The overall knowledge of the player would increase, but most of it will be limited to strategies that are one or two steps deep. I am a bit confused as to how the system learns deep strategies in case of a single player playing both sides. Surely this will not be the scenario, in case both sides are different actors having their own states.  submitted by /u/AZEEES [link] [comments]
