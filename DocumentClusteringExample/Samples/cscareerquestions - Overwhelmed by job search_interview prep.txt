Overwhelmed by job search/interview prep
Hi, I'm a recent CS grad and I'm currently looking for a job. While this subreddit has offered golden advice on how to look for a job and prepare for interviews, it's also completely overwhelming. "You should do a really good side project to make your resume stand out." "Work through Cracking the Coding Interview so that you're prepared." "You have to do at least 300-400 Leetcode problems before you can be comfortable doing technical interviews." "You should be sending out at least 30 applications every week."  This is all advice that I've read on here, and while I do plan to do it all eventually, I have to ask is it really necessary to do all this just to land an entry level job? Because at this rate its going to take me 2-3 months to do all of that.  submitted by /u/Andalusian_Monk [link] [comments]
