Looking for advice from those with internship experience at Twitch and/or Airbnb
As the title indicates, I would love to hear about your internship experiences at any of Twitch and Airbnb. e.g. culture, did you enjoy the work, mentorship, and overall pros/cons would be very much appreciated :) Thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/dsorcont [link] [comments]
