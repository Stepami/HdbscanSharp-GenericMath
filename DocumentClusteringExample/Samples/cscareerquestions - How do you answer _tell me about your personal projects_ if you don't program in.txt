How do you answer "tell me about your personal projects" if you don't program in your spare time?
I graduated just over a year ago and I've been working for a small company in Redwood City, California since I got my degree. I have a passion for programming and I am decent at it but honestly I treat it as a career, not a hobby. The last thing I want to do when I get home or have any free time is spend it on the computer. I love going hiking, playing soccer, and spending time with my friends in San Francisco over the weekend. Lately I've been trying to switch companies but at all 4 of the onsite interviews that I have had so far I have been asked about what kind of programming I do in my spare time and my personal projects. I honestly have no idea how to answer this. Do I tell the interviewer that software engineering is just my career and not my hobby? I usually end up just talking about projects I have worked on at work and past internships but this doesn't seem to be the answer they are looking for.  submitted by /u/underFRIDGE [link] [comments]
