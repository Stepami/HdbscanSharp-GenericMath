Employed Developer -- Unrelated Degree, Should I get a CS degree or even a CS Masters ?
I've been an employed Full-stack developer now for about 4-5 years, 32 years old. I sort of landed in the role based on necessity and showing the willingness to learn on my own to become successful. I want to eventually leave my current gig to do new things in the industry and I'm contemplating whether I should pursue a CS degree online to fill in the missing gaps of an official education to help get me past HR screens. I've been eyeing either doing an Online Masters program through Colorado State University, or an Online post-bacc though something like Oregon State University. While working full time of course. I'm a bit hesitant whether to jump right into a masters program with out academic CS courses under my belt, even though I'm really well versed and experienced in real world CS. I'm waffling on this, whether to get a masters, a 2nd degree post-bacc, or to just focus on my side projects... I just feel like I'm not getting past the HR check box of having a CS degree and getting interviews when I should be. I get job interviews in specialized areas of development, such as GIS since thats what my initial major was, but i'm looking to break out of that niche field. Any thoughts or advice or personal experience is appreciated! Thanks.  submitted by /u/supraGeoDev [link] [comments]
