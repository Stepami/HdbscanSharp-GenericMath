No job :( What should I do?
I am graduating from a top 20 school as a CS major this December. Applied for 200 companies but I get ghosted from most of them. I just apply online everywhere like a shotgun. I know it's bad but got no referrals :( My problem is that my experience is not solid. This is what I apply with: https://imgur.com/a/mcmud I am getting mixed reviews: 1) Work on good side projects vs Companies don't care about side projects 2) Do Node.js, React and etc vs Do something that makes you stand out What should I do to boost up my ratio? Thanks!  submitted by /u/ripppnojob [link] [comments]
