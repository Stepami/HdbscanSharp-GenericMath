Overpaid intern, I tried negotiating a higher intern return offer. I think I messed up
Okay, I think I might just be panicking for no reason but here's my situation. I'm a junior now. This past summer, I got paid the equivalent of $100k/yr + housing to intern at this place in a medium COL area at Firm X. I got a return internship offer for the same pay exactly at Firm X I got another offer from a VERY similar firm (firm Y) in the same area. Equivalent to $125k/yr + housing. I enjoyed working at Firm X and don't think I like the culture at Firm Y as much. So I sent an email to my Firm X recruiter, asking if I could negotiate my offer at Firm X for returning internship. I didn't say exactly what I wanted, just that I'd like to schedule a call.  Now I'm kind of realizing interns don't really have much negotiating power so I think I made a fool of myself. Was this a dumb move? I really don't want to damage my relationship with Firm X because I generally enjoyed the work+coworkers and the full time benefits are good EDIT: I should also note I don't really care that much about how much I make over the summer, but rather am more concerned about the potential salary of a full time offer  submitted by /u/PleaseRecycleThrowAw [link] [comments]
