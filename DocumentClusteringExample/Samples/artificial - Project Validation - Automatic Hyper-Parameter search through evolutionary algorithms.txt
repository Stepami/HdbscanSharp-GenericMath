Project Validation - Automatic Hyper-Parameter search through evolutionary algorithms
Hi! I’m working at a startup called whitesmith and together with three colleagues we are starting to work on a new product. The product is an Open Source tool to autonomously search the hyper-parameters space efficiently using evolutionary algorithms. We had this idea because we felt that we lost too much time trying to find the right parameters, so we want to create a tool that makes you/us spend less time on parametrization and more time on the models and analysing the data. We are still in the early stages of development, and we wanted to test the market and validate our idea. We would like to ask you to help us by answering a quick survey, that should take less than 5 minutes to fulfil. Feel free to give us feedback and ask whatever you want, I’ll try to answer everything as soon as I can. The link to the survey is here  submitted by /u/gunzdash [link] [comments]
