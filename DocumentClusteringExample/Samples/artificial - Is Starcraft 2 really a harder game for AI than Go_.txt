Is Starcraft 2 really a harder game for AI than Go?
It seems to me it is not harder but just requires a different set of skills that have to do with hidden information. Go on the other hand has all these complex patterns that can arise which makes it harder.  submitted by /u/744196884 [link] [comments]
