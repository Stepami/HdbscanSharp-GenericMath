Company just had a massive layoff
My employment as a software engineer just got terminated, including a number of other people in the business. Came as a shock to everyone, but this is the corporate world we live in, and money is number 1. I got a termination offer and I have a few days to look it over and sign off. I'm wondering what my options here are? I want to negotiate for something higher but I'm not sure how to. Any opinions on this matter would be great. I also need to update my resume now, but am worried how my experience at this company would look. I was only there for a few months and I can explain the layoff in person, but I'm worried that it will impact me negatively during initial resume screening. What do you guys think?  submitted by /u/ManOnTheMo0on [link] [comments]
