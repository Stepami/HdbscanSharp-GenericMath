The careers of Stanley Matthews, Peter Shilton and Gareth Barry span every single season of English football back to 1931/32
And the run is of course still active in the form of Gareth Barry Player Seasons played   Stanley Matthews 1931/32 to 1964/65  Peter Shilton 1965/66 to 1996-97  Gareth Barry 1997-98 to 2017/18*    I should note that none of the players careers overlapped. Stanley Matthews played his final game for Stoke on 6 February 1965 (aged 50!) and Peter Shilton made his debut right at the tail-end of the following season in May 1966 for Leicester City. Shilton played his final match for Leyton Orient on 21 January 1997 (age 47) and Gareth Barry wouldn't make his debut for Aston Villa till 16 months later on 2 May at the end of the 1997/98 season. Also, Shilton and Matthews both played down the divisions to varying degrees so this stat doesn't cover the First Division/Premier League. Matthews played four of his seasons in the second tier but this covers only 66 of his 697 league appearances and came right at the start and end of his career - his first two seasons and two of his final four. Shilton made 1005 league appearances of which 848 were in the top tier, 114 in the 2nd tier, 34 in the 3rd tier and nine in the 4th tier. Those nine 4th tier matches were his final nine matches in football and were all for Leyton Orient whom he'd joined after searching for playing time when stuck on 996 league appearances. I'm afraid this brings me to the aggravating gap in this whole thing. Peter Shilton, the utter bastard, didn't make a single appearance in the 1995/96 season, sitting on the bench for first Coventry then West Ham. HOWEVER, he did make his first appearance for Leyton Orient in December 1996, so one of the three players played a league match in every single calendar year going back 85 years to 1932. This is of course apart from World War Two - Matthews played his final pre-war match aged 24 and wouldn't make another league appearance till he was 31.
