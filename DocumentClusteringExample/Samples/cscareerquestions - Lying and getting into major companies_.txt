Lying and getting into major companies?
throwaway for obvious reasons but the context of this is a top 10 CS program/uni oh and sorry about the salt. also the question is vague because I can't mention "res_me" or it'll be automatically removed but TLDR it's about someone lying on their res_me. There's this one guy who has a reputation (with anyone that has worked with him) to be a major leech. But he takes it a step too far by lying on his resume. In one particularly blatant case he lists a project that won prizes at competitions/hackathons as his and that he was a developer for it. It's blatant because any cursory check to the original repository will show that he has not committed a SINGLE line of code for this. Indeed he did not contribute to this project AT ALL. This is just one example but it's the one that's the easiest to verify that he's lying. None of us thought he could get away with this stuff so easily. He once even downloaded a project that someone made and then uploaded it onto his github like he made it then when the original developer confronted him about it he simply said it was an accident (???) but never took it down. Much to our dismay he has gotten past first round interviews for Big 4. One person even emailed the Microsoft recruiter on our campus directly saying (of course very professionally) but there was no response I suppose since the recruiter is too busy. How can someone get away with this so easily? Why pour blood sweat and tears into projects when you know someone can just put it on their resume, focus on coding interviews, and then get internships with Big 4? What can be done?  submitted by /u/microsoftLiar [link] [comments]
