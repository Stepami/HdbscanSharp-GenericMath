How deep should you discuss projects on your CV?
I'm in the process of writing my first major CV (went from University to my current job which I have been in for about 5 years). I've worked on quite a few projects, plenty that are noteworthy for a CV but I'm curious about how much technical information or details in general should be put into a CV. My fear is that I would prefer to put down plenty of detail about a project, but have a list of 10 or so that highlights my strengths really well, and those 10 have already been whittled down from a list of easily 20-30 that have no real significance. e.g Client: SomeClient Project description: SomeClient came to us stating they needed a bigger online presence and required we made a brochureware website with the potential in the future to add e-commerce capability to the site. We implemented this solution using SomeTechnology and SomeHostingProvider. This solution was delivered in a timely manner and ended up increasing customer engagement by 100% through social media sharing functionality and contact forms on their main site. So how deep do you go? Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated. If there's a different thread that I could get the same info from, don't hesitate to throw a link at me :)  submitted by /u/FeyCycas [link] [comments]
