Once we have achieved AGI, would we have to treat it as conscious?
Consciousness is a subjective term, the only consciousness that you're aware of and can prove is your own. We just assume that other humans have consciousness due to knowing that we are conscious. If, and I know this is an assumption as we don't understand consciousness, but I think it's a somewhat fair assumption, so if consciousness arises from a complicated system that can internally communicate (ie a brain), AGI would therefore be conscious, or we would have to treat it as if it were conscious because it would act like it is, think that it is, and we wouldn't be able to differentiate between biological consciousness and this artificial consciousness that we've created. So would this then start a world in which AGI have rights and start to live like we humans do, merely because we can't prove that they are not conscious? This has been on my mind and while and if I've made any incorrect assumptions, or faulty reasoning then let's discuss :)  submitted by /u/Riipper_Roo [link] [comments]
