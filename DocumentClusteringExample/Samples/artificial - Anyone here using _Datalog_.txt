Anyone here using "Datalog"?
I want to find and use a deductive database system that I can access from Python. Yes I tried Google and I'm looking at several but I'm looking for people who have experience with Datalog. Which implementation do you use? Anything you can say about it. I want something that is actively developed and has a reasonable size user base so it will likely be around in 4 or 5 years. Maybe best to just use Prolog? For those wanting to know whites Datalog. It is a Prolog subset. With a dedictive database I can put in "horse, dog, snake, whale" then ask "How many quadrupeds?" and it will say 2. Or "list the mammals" and get horse, whale. The database can apply rules to make deductions. Datalog is a lot like Prolog but is declarative.  submitted by /u/ChrisAlbertson [link] [comments]
