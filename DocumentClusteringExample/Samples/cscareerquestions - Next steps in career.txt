Next steps in career
Hello I graduated from college with a degree in CS and applied math. I have been working at a finance company ever since as an analyst. I am the only programmer in my department and I do a couple of major things. Make web applications for my department using the waterfall method. Nothing fancy most of them have basically been glorified calculators  I am in charge of editing code that someone made before me that governs the companies pricing  I develop automated testing for the number 1 bullet point  Web scrapping   I like my company but not the area so im thinking about moving and finding a new job. What kind of jobs/ salaries can I expect in the south east with my background. I have a bachelor's but no masters and have 7 months of work experience currently. I just need someone knowledgeable to talk to about this.  submitted by /u/mumblesomething95 [link] [comments]
