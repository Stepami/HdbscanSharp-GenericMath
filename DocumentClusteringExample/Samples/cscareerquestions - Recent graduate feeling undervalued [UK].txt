Recent graduate feeling undervalued [UK]
So I recently graduated in the UK with a CS degree (2:2) which was pretty weak. I managed a job offer at 20K working as a junior java dev in the banking sector (outside of London). Now 6 months in i'm in a team of 7/8 working on a project,with one other junior dev and rest mid-level (32k per year). This is going fine but I feel like I'm undetaking large proportions of work compared to the mid-level devs in my team, it seems that i'm completing work faster and actively seeking out new tasks. In meeting I contribute and participate more than most also. The work isn't going unacknowledged with seeming praise from above, and im learning a lot. It's just that at 20K, i'm producing more value than most other members. My probation ends next month and should move to 22k, then in 1 1/2 years be on 32k, but should I ask for more early? Is it inappropriate to do so? I don't necessarily want to leave since my dev manager is great and mentoring me massively. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated :)  submitted by /u/FlamingPenguine [link] [comments]
