Items I mention in conversation are appearing in my online shopping suggestions - how?
Firstly, apologies if this question has no business being here. I'll be happy to remove it. Details: I do not have any of those AI machines like Alexa, Cortana, Amazon Dot or Echo, etc. I do have an iPad and an iPhone, supposedly barred from using the mic unless I specifically turn it on. I mentioned over the weekend that I need new curtains for the living room. When I logged on to (bigboxstore.com) today, what is featured? You guessed it. Curtains. I have noticed this with a few other products lately, and it is a little freaky. Is there some bright way to make it stop? PS: I live alone, so no one else has searched for those items.  submitted by /u/LicenseToParent [link] [comments]
