Looking for Academic Journals/Information on Artificial Neural Networks.
I'm writing a paper for a college class over Artificial Neural Networks. I am doing research through the school's library databases but most of what I am finding is more specified to a subject, i.e. ANN for analyzing soil samples. I need something a bit more broader as the paper is for a Gen Ed English class rather than a major specific class. I need to represent the subject in a way that people unfamiliar with Computer Science can understand. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/Nerzana [link] [comments]
