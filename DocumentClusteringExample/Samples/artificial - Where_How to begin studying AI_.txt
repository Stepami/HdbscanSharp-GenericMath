Where/How to begin studying AI?
Hello, I have bachelor in Computer Science and I want to start my studies on AI field by my own. I would like to know if some of you had this experience before, and what sources of knowledge did you use. I am struggling to discover how to begin studying AI to apply in my personal projects or to work with that some day. Any tips will be welcome. Thanks. Edit1: I am interested in the research field of AI.  submitted by /u/kephiroth [link] [comments]
