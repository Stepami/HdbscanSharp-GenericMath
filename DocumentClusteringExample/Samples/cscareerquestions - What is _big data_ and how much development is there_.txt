What is "big data" and how much development is there?
I'm debating doing an internship project with "big data". The team is called NoSQL and Apache Spark. I figured that it would involve Scala and Java. I don't actually know anything about databases or Hadoop, so I think this would be a good learning experience. However, my concern is that it'll be mostly scripting. Would I be doing any development work or is it just aggregating data through queries? Thanks! EDIT: I figured this question doesn't really make sense. I don't have the concrete project yet, but does work using Hadoop / Apache Spark entail mostly setting stuff up? I have a feel like they're mostly tools, I don't actually understand what they do. hope this makes sense...  submitted by /u/ComputerBunnyMath123 [link] [comments]
