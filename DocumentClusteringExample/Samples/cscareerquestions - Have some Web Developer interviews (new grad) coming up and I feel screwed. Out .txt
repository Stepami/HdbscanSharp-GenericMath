Have some Web Developer interviews (new grad) coming up and I feel screwed. Out of my depth.
These positions are standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript and frankly very rusty. I haven't touched these skills in months since I graduated. My exposure to Web Dev is from a course I took in my last semester of my last year, I did and learned a lot from building simple site, node.js chat app, text parser and a trading website. Although I am confident in my ability to learn and program and learned a lot in that course and was successful in completing the projects, at this current time, I am not up to speed on the syntax and if you asked me to build a simple, small website, I wouldn't be able to without using Google extensively to brush up on the syntax. The interview is in a couple of days. How can I best maximize my chances for the interview?  submitted by /u/shyguy174 [link] [comments]
