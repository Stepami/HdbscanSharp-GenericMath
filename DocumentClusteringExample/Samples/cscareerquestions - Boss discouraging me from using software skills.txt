Boss discouraging me from using software skills
I'm an electronic technician 1 year out of community college and during our down times I've learned to use CAPL which has expanded my knowledge of C/C++. I've been getting better and better using my skills to enhance our testing. The problem is my boss keeps telling me not to help people with CANalayzer/CAPL related problems. He told me to "forget CAPL" because other groups may want me. I'm not sure what to do. I've really fell in love with programing since I've been given an opportunity to interface with hardware. I really want to learn more, possibly from other groups in the company. Since he's my boss I'm not sure what I could do without directly risking my job. Has anyone been in a situation like this or have an opinion?  submitted by /u/lockjawz [link] [comments]
