MS in CS after a career break?
Hi, I am a software developer working in a well paying software company since 3 years (right after college). I am about to leave my job soon to work on a business of my own (because I think it's way more lucrative). It's unfortunately not a tech start-up which would have increased my chances of getting an admit in a good college, but it is something in the entertainment space that involves just some amount of coding. If it doesn't work out, I have plans of doing an MS in the US in machine learning and AI computer science. I am from a good undergrad college, my grades are decent, GRE score is decent, have published a few papers. But I am worried they will turn me down because of this break. Is that a possibility? ty  submitted by /u/kungfufightin [link] [comments]
