Aside from autonomous weapons sytems and driverless cars, what other form of aritficial intelligence raises issues?
Particularly of liability. I'm doing my law undergraduate dissertation and am trying to find a narrow enough topic. At the moment, I'm set on liability and the issues raised by AI in relation to that. I don't want to do anything TOO big as its only 10,000 words, but also dont wanna do autonomous weapons systems or driverless cars as I'm trying to find a gap in the research.  submitted by /u/LauraRMCF [link] [comments]
