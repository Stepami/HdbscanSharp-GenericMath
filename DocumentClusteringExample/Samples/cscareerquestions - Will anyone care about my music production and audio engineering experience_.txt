Will anyone care about my music production and audio engineering experience?
I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Some background, I'm a senior in my last year of college pursuing a BA in Computer Systems and am applying for internships and soon jobs once I graduate Summer 2018. Most of my free time was spent making music, however. I've always had a passion for coding and computers, I'm confident that I write great code and am talented. But am late on making computer science related projects and extracurriculars for my resume (working on it now). That said, I have plenty of experience in audio engineering and music production. I've played in bands and put on shows with fully programmed lights and video synced to the music. I've produced, mixed, and mastered bands as well as made plenty of music in a wide variety of genres. Even did mastering for podcasts. I just don't know if anyone cares. I have some albums I've done on my LinkedIn, and music related software I'm very proficient in, but I don't know if it's just crowding space or not. I'm kinda thinking of just scrapping it for room. Is there room for it? How do I word it and keep a balance of audio and programming? Is there a way I should approach this? Thank you so much for the advice.  submitted by /u/skujaster [link] [comments]
