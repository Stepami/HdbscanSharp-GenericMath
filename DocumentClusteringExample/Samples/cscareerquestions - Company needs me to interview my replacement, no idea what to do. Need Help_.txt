Company needs me to interview my replacement, no idea what to do. Need Help.
Hello, Currently I work as a full stack software developer at a small company. I was interviewing around and I received an offer from another company that I decided to accept. However, because my current company is small, and the development team even smaller, my current company needs me to interview my potential replacements. I have never interviewed anyone before and have no idea what to ask. I wanted to know if anyone has ever been in this situation before? And if so, how did they handle it? Also ANY tips or advice on how to interview people/what to ask would be helpful. Also, lol @ the situation I am in because I have recently been grinding leetcode and reviewing CTCI to pass my interviews and it worked great. But now I have to actually give the interviews and I am completely lost.  submitted by /u/thewholestack [link] [comments]
