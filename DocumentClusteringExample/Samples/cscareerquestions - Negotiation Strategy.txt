Negotiation Strategy
I'm trying to negotiate an smaller mid-late startup company to give me an equivalent but ideally higher compensation than my return offer from big4. Here are the initial offer details. start up is in SF with ~300 people Big4: 103k (113k for Bay area), 65k/4 RSU, 52k/2 signing Startup: 108k, 55k/4 stock option, 5k signing The stock options is 10k shared and the 50k is based on strike price and current valuation from most recent found of funding. Any one have any advice on what to use as leverage to negotiate and even better if you could suggestions to phrase it politely while still holding power My current thoughts are to say 1. the compensation obviously below that of Big4 and I'd like you to match the offer 2. Since the company is smaller, I'd be taking on more responsibility than at Big4 and should be compensated higher. Also if they ask for my ideal compensation I was thinking of asking for 125k and 20k shares ~100k options increase Does this sound reasonable?
