AMA Request: Developers in the legal tech/e-Discovery sector
This is a developing sector that I think more recent grads should at least know exists since all I ever read about here is big-four and hedge funds. But I'd like to hear more details from people who actually work there. I know Bloomberg has BLAW, Lexis/Nexis has been around forever, and there are other firms that sell legal-case searching software. I'll just throw out a few questions to get things started: Do you like your job ? What are the technical and non-technical challenges ? What kind of tools do you use ? ELI5 e-discovery Do you work with lawyers and/or learn much about law while doing your job ? What kind of person would you recommend work in this industry ? Do they have software that (attempts to) predict the outcome of trials or the best legal strategy to apply based on caselaw ? Is AI used at all in the industry ?   submitted by /u/CuckEmonster [link] [comments]
