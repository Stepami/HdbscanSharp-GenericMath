How to land an internship at a top tech company as a sophomore?
Just any advice in general would be awesome. I've applied for most of the big tech companies and have received coding challenges from a few, although I haven't gotten a lot of positive responses yet. Like I said if there's any advice or knowledge to be shared, I would be super appreciative!  submitted by /u/TheAnglerfish1616 [link] [comments]
