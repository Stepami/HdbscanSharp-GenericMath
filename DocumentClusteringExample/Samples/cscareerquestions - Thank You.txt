Thank You
This sub was really where I first began to look into computer science. Itâ€™s also where I developed a passion to learn more and more about this field. Ultimately, it has led me to finally pick a major, one that a few years ago and even a few months ago I knew little about. This sub has been amazing in helping me develop a passion and I deeply appreciate that. Stay awesome.  submitted by /u/essej1233 [link] [comments]
