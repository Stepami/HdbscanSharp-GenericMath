How to approach AGI?
I'm really interested in AGI... I've been learning about AI and AGI for some time now and studying computer science in university. The subjects that interest me the most are: Philosophy: phil of mind phil of language epistemology phil of mathematics Logic: Classical and non-classical(intuitionistic) Theoretical CS ALife Complexity Science(complex adaptive systems) I don't want to concentrate on current ml/stats approached towards AI and would like to find a way to approach it more theoretically and focus more on reasoning systems to make use of my interest in logic... What should I do? Should I continue majoring in cs while taking some courses logic/phil or what?  submitted by /u/yzsn3b [link] [comments]
