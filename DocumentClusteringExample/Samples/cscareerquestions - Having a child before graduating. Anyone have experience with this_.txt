Having a child before graduating. Anyone have experience with this?
My Wife and I are wanting to have a baby. I have 1 more year left in college. I was wondering if there's any reason why we shouldn't do this other than not having a full time job lined up (yet) after college? Or if anyone had any tips/ advice for graduating while having a child. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/InfoSecJedi [link] [comments]
