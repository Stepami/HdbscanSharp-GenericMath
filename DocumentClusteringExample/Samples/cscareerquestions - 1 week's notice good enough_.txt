1 week's notice good enough?
Employer lied about job and lured me in. Been here 3 months and am wasting my time and money big time. Was supposed to become a full time employee with benefits after probationary period, but yesterday he outright admitted I'll be with the contracting company forever. Only am getting $23.50/hr for Java work and have secured a job else where for much, much more. Hotel is eating every bit of what I am getting. I hate being in this state of uncertainty. Gonna tell him sayonara this Monday, which is exactly the day he says he's going to give me a "big project." (I think he found out about me applying to another job. Probably because I printed out my resume at work and he saw the print job or the guy next to me overheard me talking to a recruiter ratted me out.) At any rate I don't care. Only 1 week because that's how much I've already paid up til next Friday.  submitted by /u/poopthepoopiestpoop [link] [comments]
