EU redditors who moved to the US, how hard was it to get used to the country?
I am an EU resident, and all my life I've been dreaming about living and working in the US. I know, the grass is always greener on the other side. The only thing that's stopping me, is that I feel like if I moved there I would have literally nobody. All of my friends are here. How hard is it to get new friends, and socialize? Whenever I am alone, I feel like shit. What did you do when you moved there?  submitted by /u/dunkanmaestro [link] [comments]
