Jumping from an Asset Management company to a Quant shop.
I'm working at a very small asset management company. But I've been hired as a data scientist, and have been working on quant projects, which will definitely be valuable experience for working at a quant shop, but ultimately, the pay is not that great, and the company is not that prestigous. This is my first job out of university, and finance is interesting for me, so I want to jump ship and move to one of the big4 quant shops, like AQR or Two Sigma. I haven't sent out any resumes to these companies ever, but I want to do so very soon. What are some push backs that I'm going to receive? What should I be aware of? Does my story make sense?  submitted by /u/MoroseBurrito [link] [comments]
