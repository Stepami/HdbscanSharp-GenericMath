Is my employer asking too much of me?
I started my job in April about a month before I graduated. I was immediately put on a massive project, basically by myself with almost no collaboration or mentorship. This project is also very complicated, as it is a data ingestion pipeline that has a ton of interconnected and moving parts so there is a lot that can go wrong. I have been left to make most of the design decisions with the occasional input from others when I ask for it, but other than that there are no code reviews or anything like that. Now, after raising my concerns about all this repeatedly they are finally making some changes and in about a week I will get someone else to work on the project with me. Trouble is I think it might be a little too late. I have written over 10K lines of code and it will probably take anyone several weeks just to get up to speed with a basic understanding of this system. I am getting pretty overwhelmed with trying to maintain and add features to this code base, as it it volatile and I keep running into issues and there isn't anyone to turn to usually because nobody else understands it. I like being challenged but I feel like I am in over my head here, especially for a recent grad making a modest 55K. Am I justified in feeling this way or do I need to just suck it up and work through it? Both? Thanks.  submitted by /u/The_Only_Zephos [link] [comments]
