How to go about making a site for projects to run?
I have seen many engineers with their own site where they showcase the projects they've made. Does anyone have some advice on how to make my own personal site where I can showcase/run the different projects I've made? (Regardless of what language they're in?) Here is an example of what I'm talking about: http://antrikshy.com/projects/ (specifically the way you can click on "The MCU Index" and get the program to start up on the next page). As of now, my projects have only ever been ran on Cloud 9 or my computer. Any advice around this topic would be great! Thank you.  submitted by /u/Kizzlez [link] [comments]
