Industry-focused master's degree?
I'm looking into getting a master's degree in CSE. One of the engineers I work with (not in software) went through a program for their master's degree in another field that involved going through 2-3 quarters of classes and then several quarters of internship experience. The program also had a lot of resources for getting internships through job search, resume, and interview workshops as well as their own network of companies that hired interns directly from them. The majority of those interns were then also offered full-time jobs at the end of the program. Sometimes this is also called an applied masters. I'm wondering if something similar exists in the computer science field. I've looked around a bit, but haven't seen anything outside of the traditional masters degree track. Does anybody know of a program like this? Or have you gone to a college that had a particularly good relationship with industry partners?  submitted by /u/Craigbuell [link] [comments]
