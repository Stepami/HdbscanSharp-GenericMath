How would you describe your current work ethic on the job?
Mine is more I'll work hard, but I won't kill myself to meet expectations. I generally look for the path of least resistance when applicable when working on a project then way the pros and cons of doing so... I guess I'm a slacker in more ways than one (or management material)  submitted by /u/SpaceBreaker [link] [comments]
