Training enviroment for "director class" game AI implementations ?
For further clarification im a begginer with a heavy interest in ai director systems such as the director in left 4 dead as an example. Essentially a director that is able to spawn items, mobs, adjust difficult setting, etc based on information such as the players mood and or stress lvl calculated by various factors. Watches the player and adjusts the game accordingly. I would prefer to stay within python as i have some ideas in line with evolutionary algorithms and deep learning/reinforcement learning. I have heard of creating custom enviroments in open ai gym/universe. Would coding a simple game from scrath via something like pygame perhaps be easier for this ? Sorry for the vague details in advanced just need a starting direction. EDIT I basically want the least effort for enviroments to learn, write, implement, and in cases of deep learning etc to train ai systems based on the concept not so much to build a difficult game around it to start if that makes any sense  submitted by /u/Duckyonquacks [link] [comments]
