I’ve been a manager for 3 months, finding myself struggling to keep up, advice?
Hey guys, So about three months ago my manager left to start a new branch of our company in SD, so I ended up falling into his position and taking over his clients. I leveraged it into a huge pay raise but I don’t think I knew what I was walking into in terms of workload. I find myself overloaded on things to do just from my email inbox alone, but then I’ll go to meetings for half my day walking away with more work to do. My company has been good about distributing the workload he had among a team of engineers and a PM, but I just can’t seem to keep up. Any advice on how to be a better manager or at least handle high workloads better? Thanks!  submitted by /u/palakobama [link] [comments]
