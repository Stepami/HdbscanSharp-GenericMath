Advice on promotion
The Back Story - feel free to skip this part. I've been working at a small software company for about a year and a half. I was hired as a Help Desk tech but I've put in a ton of work outside of this including bug testing, front end web development, data conversions, and custom access development for customers. After waiting for a while now, it finally happened: I'm being offered a new position in the company. I'm moving from Customer Support to Product Development and will be a QA Specialist. After putting in lots of work recently to improve our QA process and help with some major releases, I've finally been offered the position. The Problem The problem is, the pay seems really low. Average QA Specialists in my city make $51,000. I won't even be in the $40,000s (high 30s). In fact, it's a very minor raise from my previous Customer Support position. Responsibilities include: Manual product testing Coordinating larger scale tests with the support team Heading up a new beta program Implementation of automated testing Involvement in design specifications for new releases Data conversions and other custom development work for customers Front end web development (not really a function of this position but something I will be doing). Many other typical QA functions  I don't have a ton of experience. This is really my first job in this field, but I do have an associate's degree in Web Development. Am I correct that this seems like a low salary, even for an entry level position? Or is this typical in the industry? Overall I like where I work and like the experience I'm gaining, but I can't help but feel a little disappointed in this promotion. Any advice?  submitted by /u/ReclaimerDC [link] [comments]
