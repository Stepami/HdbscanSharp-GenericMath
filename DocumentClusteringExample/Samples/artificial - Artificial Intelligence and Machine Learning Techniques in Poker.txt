Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques in Poker
I am currently at university writing up my proposal for my final year project (Games Programming Bsc) and have hit a wall. In my pre-proposal I wrote about developing a poker game which features AI created using machine learning. Whilst I know the fundamentals of what I want to study, I my project needs to have a clear goal/outcome that will make an impact in the related industry. What approaches could I take in my project which would not only make it exciting and challenging but also help solve problem? I liked the idea of creating AI that learns the a players strategy but I think that may be too difficult to implement. Do any of you have any suggestions? Sticking to the theme of Poker (most likely Texas Hold'em), AI, ML, Neural Networks etc.  submitted by /u/AaronKelsey [link] [comments]
