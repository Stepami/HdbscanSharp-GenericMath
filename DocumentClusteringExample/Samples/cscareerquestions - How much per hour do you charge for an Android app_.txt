How much per hour do you charge for an Android app?
I am making an Android app for a client (with AR technology using Vuforia) and the initial budget we discussed was a few thousand dollars. I was wondering how much do people usually charge for Android apps. Per hour or lump sums.  submitted by /u/naphalmsalt [link] [comments]
