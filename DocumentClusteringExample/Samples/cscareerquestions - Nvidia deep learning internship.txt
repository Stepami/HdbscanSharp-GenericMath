Nvidia deep learning internship
Hey guys, I got an interview with nvidia for a deep learning internship and this is like my dream job. I'm an undergrad and I've taken Andrew Ng's ML course. wondering if any one has done this interview before? I want to be as prepared as possible. thanks  submitted by /u/rola34442 [link] [comments]
