Project file naming conventions
Hey all. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, so if so please redirect me. I'm an Associate Software Developer in a relatively new but fast growing company in Texas. I've finished their "bootcamp" and am in the process of getting integrated into my team. The team in question is mostly the devs from another company that mine acquired last year that have been together for 10+ years so they're all pretty familiar with the codebase and each other as well as being pretty set in their ways. My question has to do with file and folder naming conventions in the codebase. When I clone certain repos from git, there are some files/folders that are duplicates just with different capitalization (ex ~/foo/Bar.html and ~/foo/bar.html or ~/folder/file.txt and ~/Folder/file.txt). Being that I am on a Mac and you cannot do that on Macs, when I clone, I only get the first one that it comes across. But then when Git compares my file to the ones on the remote, it compares it to both instances and thinks I changed one when I didn't. When I brought this up to the senior dev he told me it was just a problem with my Git configuration and that I had to figure it out on my own. Is he right? Is naming files/folders in this way common/widely accepted? It seems unnecessary and potentially confusing to me. Edit: Follow up question. How should I bring this up to the team as someone who just joined and doesn't really have much push yet without ruffling too many feathers, particularly with that senior dev I talked to about it already?  submitted by /u/cteeters [link] [comments]
