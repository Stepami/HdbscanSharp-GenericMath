How valuable do you think a top CS education?
My uncle had the choice to go to either a top CS school or a decent state school. He ultimately chose to go to the state school because it's cheaper, but 10 years later he says if he could go back he would choose the other school. How much debt would you be willing to go into to attend a top CS school? Assuming you can get a job after both programs, what benefits would the good CS program have? Is the network or rigor of a good CS school really worth going in debt for?  submitted by /u/rainhorse3 [link] [comments]
