Would a back-end dev be required to code in CSS?
I'm going through the stuff on Codecademy and SoloLearn and don't even want to finish. CSS is simple/easy but it's just so boring to me. I really don't care about making pretty colors, cool shapes, and fancy animations. I can read it and understand it but I wouldn't be able to write a CSS page from scratch as I just don't have that artistic ability. I think JavaScript would be a turn-off for me for the same reason (a lot of it is about making things look nice). Would this hinder a career in back-end development? I want to focus my energy on getting a deeper understanding of PHP and learning to use Python/Django.  submitted by /u/thirdworldsociety [link] [comments]
