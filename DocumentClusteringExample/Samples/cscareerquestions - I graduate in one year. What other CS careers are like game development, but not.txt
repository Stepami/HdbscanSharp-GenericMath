I graduate in one year. What other CS careers are like game development, but not necessarily game development, and how to prepare for them?
Hi, So I'm about to go into my last year of college and all of my previous internships have been in web development. I've realized this is not what I want to do with my career. I don't want to be a full stack developer. I want to do non-web development and work on complex applications. I looked around and I like what I've seen in terms of game programming. NOTE: I am not much of a gamer, so I'm not being distracted by a love of the product rather than the process. What I like is the use of C and C++ and the type of work that is involved in creating "high-level" (EDIT: "complex and deeply technical") software. What I'd like to know is what other industries do similar types of work? With 14 months before graduation, aside from maintaining a 4.0 cGPA, what would you focus on in terms of projects and skills to be ready to apply as a solid junior dev to this type of position? I will be applying to games companies as well (they seem to like c, c++ and Unity work), but I want to prepare a well rounded portfolio. Should I be making games? Doing online courses? Ultimately, I'm trying to figure out what skills apply to game development that would also apply to similar jobs in other fields. Any suggestions/advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Also, any resources/book suggestions would be great. Thanks for the help. Sorry this is so long. Sorry about the throwaway.  submitted by /u/forstThrowaway [link] [comments]
