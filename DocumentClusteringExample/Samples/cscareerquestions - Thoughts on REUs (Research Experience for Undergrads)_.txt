Thoughts on REUs (Research Experience for Undergrads)?
I'm thinking I may want to go to graduate school so I would like to try my hand at research. If I decide to stay in industry, how do companies view REUs as opposed to internships? Have you ever done an REU before? Did you like it?  submitted by /u/xiguas [link] [comments]
