Easiest states to get a junior developer job?
Hello everyone, I'm a self-taught dev and i've been having a really hard time landing a job. I've also been programming for 2 years. I've done projects and grinded leetcode. I'm from NYC and i've applied to over 100 places. I'm willing to move to another state to get experience. I'll move to the middle of nowhere honestly.  submitted by /u/purpleplastica [link] [comments]
