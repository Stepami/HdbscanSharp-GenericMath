AI designing humans.
I have been wondering if you asked an artificially intelligent machine, to the extent we have those now, to design the ideal bipedal animal. Would you end up with a human looking shape or something more apeish? Anyone who can offer some previous studies or anything linking back to the proposed best shape for a human would be awesome. Also first time positing so yay!  submitted by /u/TheRealMartyByrd [link] [comments]
