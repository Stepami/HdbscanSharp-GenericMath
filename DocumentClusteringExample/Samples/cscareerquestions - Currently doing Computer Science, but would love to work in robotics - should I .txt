Currently doing Computer Science, but would love to work in robotics - should I minor in electrical engineering?
I know this is the CS career subreddit, and ultimately I think I still want to work in the software side of design. I'd love to be in a position where I can work on AI and also help design the mechanical hardware of robots. Are minors useful in actually opening doors for other careers? I feel like I should have chosen Computer Engineering instead of Computer Science. I guess I could spend an extra year and switch to CE if it would be a better degree for my career plans. Any advice?  submitted by /u/GingaTurtles [link] [comments]
