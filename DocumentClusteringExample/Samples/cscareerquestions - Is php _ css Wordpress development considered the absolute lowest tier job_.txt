Is php / css Wordpress development considered the absolute lowest tier job?
It's my first job as my dream is to go cloud development(gotta start small i guess). But i feel like a poor janitor of the CS world.Is there anything worse except tech support? Im wondering if its hurting my prospects for a serious software engineer job  submitted by /u/vdk89 [link] [comments]
