Transitioning from Developer to Computer Security/Infosec
Hi all, I'm currently a fresh out of college developer working for a small-medium sized company (5000 employees worldwide). In college I focused most of my upper division electives on computer security topics (privacy, cryptography and a general computer security course). The company I'm at deals with computer security itself but I'm working as a generic developer on a web application. I've talked to a mentor (outside of work) about my goal of transitioning into a computer security position and he basically said that I should do so as fast as possible and that I'm essentially wasting my time at this company. Now I was planning on moving into the field in 1-2 years so this comes as a bit of a surprise to me. My initial plan was to work at this company for 1-2 years while building up computer security knowledge (Certifications, bug bounties, projects etc.) and eventually move into an Application Security position (or intrusion response, security analyst or what have you). I understand that the skills I learn as a junior developer are not immediately transferable to all security positions but I feel that they would at least be useful for an application security position and at least tangentially helpful for other positions. Does my plan sound feasible? Am I completely wasting my time? Any thoughts that you might have would be extremely helpful.  submitted by /u/compsecthrowaway1 [link] [comments]
