Will it lower my chance of getting an interview if something indicates that I'm an international student ?
Now applying to Engineering Practicum. In one of the essay questions about the background I want to talk about being a LGBTQ in China. But I don't know if that, indicating that I'm not a US citizen, will lower my chance of getting an interview.  submitted by /u/desperateSopho [link] [comments]
