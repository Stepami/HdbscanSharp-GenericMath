Has anyone expanded those AI walking simulations to a sports simulation?
After seeing this GIF on the front page, I wondered- could these sims be expanded to replicate a sports sim? I'd be interested to see what would happen if you took six of these entities, created a ball in a somewhat realistic environment, and told them to try to kick the ball into an opposing goal like a soccer game. Would the AIs be able to develop specific moves and behaviors to kick the ball? Could they develop strategic positioning to coordinate behaviors?  submitted by /u/mpavlofsky [link] [comments]
