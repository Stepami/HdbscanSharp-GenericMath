Just went to a career fair and not sure if results are good or bad
I'm a freshman right now and last summer I interned as a high school intern at Microsoft. This year I really want to go back for their explore internship, so I went to my school's career fair and talked to the microsoft recruiter. When I went there was a huge line and it took like 30 minutes to get to the recruiter, but when I did my interaction with them was really brief. Basically we did introductions, they took my resume, saw that I was previously a microsoft intern, commented positively about that, and then right away asked if I had any other internship offers from other companies to which I responded that I did and they asked what the deadline was so I told them and then they took some notes and filed my resume in their stack. Then we parted ways. The whole interaction was super brief and I didn't even get a second to ask a question. I get that they wanted to move things along considering the huge line, but other people I know who talked to microsoft actually got to have a conversation, although they didn't get asked if they had any other offers. So I'm not really sure. Is this a good sign for my chances or bad?  submitted by /u/maoxingren [link] [comments]
