What was this industry like in the 80s and 90s?
Was it as trendy as it is today? What were interviews like? Did you have to whiteboard algorithms + data structures? Was the West Coast tech company culture (lax dress code + perks) a thing, or just a few companies? Did anyone here work for a bullshit dotcom that went belly up in 2001?  submitted by /u/proboardslolv5 [link] [comments]
