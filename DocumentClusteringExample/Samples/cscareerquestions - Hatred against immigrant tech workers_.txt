Hatred against immigrant tech workers?
Been noticing this a lot in this sub as well as the work place and even on streets in America. I would appreciate some Americans spoke out their thoughts. Disclaimer: I'm an H1-B. IIRC, America is a land of immigrants, and most people come from European/Asian background so I do not understand why this community is against talented immigrants? Certain Indian firms such as Infosys, I am also against, but people here seem to hate even those H1-B's who are getting jobs at {Zuck, Page-rank}, which makes no sense. This happens in the office as well, and is a very bad thing to experience.  submitted by /u/csthrowaway383g [link] [comments]
