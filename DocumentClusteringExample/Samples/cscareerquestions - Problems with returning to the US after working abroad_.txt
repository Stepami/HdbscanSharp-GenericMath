Problems with returning to the US after working abroad.
Hi guys. I've been working as a Software Engineer in Dublin, Ireland for almost 2 years now after finishing school, and I'm looking to come back to the states. I'm a US citizen, but I've gotten a little nervous after reading this post. Specifically Quick stats - 500 Applicants , 120 declined immediately due to no us working visa or applying from another country  I'm looking to apply to mostly larger companies. But will the fact that I currently live in Ireland be a problem or at least a bump in the road in my applications?  submitted by /u/kabutotakara [link] [comments]
