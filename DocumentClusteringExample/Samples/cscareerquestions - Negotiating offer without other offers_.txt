Negotiating offer without other offers?
Got a full time offer with the company I interned with over the summer. I want to negotiate the salary up a little bit (97.5k -> 101-103k), but I don't have any competing offers to use as leverage. How should I go about this? Lie about having another offer? Then what if they ask for it on paper? Don't negotiate at all? Be honest that I don't have other offers and still ask for the higher number?  submitted by /u/thebeststuffonearth1 [link] [comments]
