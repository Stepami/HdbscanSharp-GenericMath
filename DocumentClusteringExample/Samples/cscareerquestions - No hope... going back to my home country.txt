No hope... going back to my home country
I am an international student studying computer science at a top 20 school looking for a full time job... but no luck. I have had my resume critiqued multiple times here and have applied for about 400 companies. I have heard back from only 3 companies. I made it to final round for one company, but they rejected me before I even had a chance for a final round. In huge debt from tuition and my parents are very disappointed. I am a failure (failed investment). The US was fun and I will miss it. I hope other international students do not end up like me.  submitted by /u/nohopenojob [link] [comments]
