How did you get your first programming job?
My wife struggling to get first developer job as she is barely invited to interviews and never got offer after one. I'm a developer myself, but I got here mainly by chance. Can you share your experience of starting software developer career?  submitted by /u/MightiestRacoon [link] [comments]
