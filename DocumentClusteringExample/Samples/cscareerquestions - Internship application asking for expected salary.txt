Internship application asking for expected salary
I'm in the process of applying for summer internships for 2018 and have come across a fairly large financial tech firm in London who ask me to input my expected salary for the position. I have no clue what to put in, it doesn't specify annual but that's what I'm assuming. I have no experience really so I don't want to go too high but also I'd prefer not to low-ball myself.  submitted by /u/SuperScouse96 [link] [comments]
