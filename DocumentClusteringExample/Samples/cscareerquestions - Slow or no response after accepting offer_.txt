Slow or no response after accepting offer?
Hi yall, I'm slightly anxious and its probably nothing. I was offered a position from a big company over email (after successful interviews). I received the offer Friday, and accepted via email on Monday but I still haven't heard back from the talent acquisition person for confirmation. I'm probably worried over nothing, but its not likely that they would rescind an offer after already making it right? How long should I wait before reaching out again to make sure everythings still good?  submitted by /u/jivan-mukta [link] [comments]
