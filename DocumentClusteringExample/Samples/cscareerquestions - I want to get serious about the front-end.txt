I want to get serious about the front-end
Some background: I went to school in an "interaction design" program, where I focused heavily on UX/UI (and the psychology behind it) and web design. My first two jobs out of college have been more design focused, and because of that, my portfolio reflects this. I have decided I want to get into front-end development as a career path, and use my design skills to help that goal. I am fairly confident in HTML5/CSS. I am brushing up on JS (have mostly used it for animations, not real interactivity) So my question is, what would you focus on? What should I be working on to get a portfolio together that would get me a front-end job (entry level)? Should I even include any of the UX work I've done? (It's for fortune 50 companies).  submitted by /u/atomictomato_x [link] [comments]
