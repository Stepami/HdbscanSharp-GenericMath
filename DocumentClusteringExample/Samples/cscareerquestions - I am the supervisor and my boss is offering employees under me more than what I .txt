I am the supervisor and my boss is offering employees under me more than what I make.
I've been at my job roughly 7 months, I was told upon hire to expect a raise of between 5-15,000 after 6 months during my review. Haven't gotten a review nor a raise. I was also told to expect a (would be welcomed) schedule change. I was promised 9-5 after 6 months of 5am-1:30pm, haven't gotten that either. Today I see a new job listing for my company offering applicants close to $7,000 MORE a year than what I currently make. What's going on?!? I have asked multiple times about my review and my schedule change. If it's an email my boss ignores it, if it's face to face he refuses to give me a straight answer. What gives?  submitted by /u/mrsabf [link] [comments]
