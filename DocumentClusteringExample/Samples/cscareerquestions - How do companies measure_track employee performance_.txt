How do companies measure/track employee performance?
Basically I’m just curious about the metrics that companies typically use to measure an employee’s performance. I just started my job about 3 months ago and it’s my first real job out of college, so I’m trying to learn what to expect. I work on a team that does agile scrum development. Do these sorts of teams measure performance based on how many stories you complete? Or is there another way it’s measured? What kind of things do other companies do?  submitted by /u/Rockmar1 [link] [comments]
