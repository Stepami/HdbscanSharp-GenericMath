What kind of jobs can a CS/Math degree get in the Humanitarian field?
Hi I am a Computer Science and maths student looking for jobs about effecting change not so much about technology or even making money. What kind of jobs are available to me? Upon graduating I will have a CS and math degree, 4 years as an IT technician in a large public school and 2 years of various volunteering gigs.  submitted by /u/eustachiomustachio [link] [comments]
