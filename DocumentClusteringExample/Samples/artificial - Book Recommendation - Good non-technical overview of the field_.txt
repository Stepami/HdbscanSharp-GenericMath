Book Recommendation - Good non-technical overview of the field?
Hi, AI is becoming increasingly prominent in both the media I consume and in industry. It's getting unavoidable. Is there a general overview of the field for a non-technical reader you could recommend? (I'm looking for more Stephen Levy-style than Peter Norvig-style)! There are a load of book rec threads on here but they're almost all request from people trying to get into the field. I'm more looking for an up-to-date recent history, how did Google/Microsoft/Amazon/Baidu or whoever get to where they are now, and what's coming down the pipeline. Any recommendations? Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/paddyjay [link] [comments]
