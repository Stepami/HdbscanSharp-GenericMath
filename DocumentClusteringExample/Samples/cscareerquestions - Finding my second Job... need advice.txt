Finding my second Job... need advice
I would like to stay as anonymous as possible so I'm going to omit company names etc. My situation in a nutshell: I've been working for this company for about a year and a half now. Its not great pay but it's plenty for me. There are quite a few perks I enjoy as well, such as: working form home, benefits, etc. However, the company is going through a transformation and will be outsourcing a lot of IT work. This is due to leaderships terrible decisions to not keep up with technology. This is the beginning of my problems. Basically my experience here has been hit or miss. I have learned a lot but I also feel as though I've not learned enough. I have worked with very old and POORLY written applications (asp.net, VB6). So I feel most of that experience was nearly worthless. However, my senior bless his soul, fought to update an older application. He pulled me into the project and I feel like I started to finally grow as a developer. I've got to have my hands in technologies such as: C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, MVC. A bit of back end and front end work. With this transformation I could be at worst left without a job within a couple years or pigeon holed into working with ServiceNow which I KNOW i do not want to be doing. I've been applying like crazy but I feel I have experience with multiple tools but not necessarily a master of any. All my work I can't share with future employers because I do not own this code. What do you guys think I should do to increase my chances in finding a better opportunity? I'm casting wide nets across the US but I barely meet minimum requirements for even Junior or entry level postings let alone mid-level. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/Skumbag_Kyle [link] [comments]
