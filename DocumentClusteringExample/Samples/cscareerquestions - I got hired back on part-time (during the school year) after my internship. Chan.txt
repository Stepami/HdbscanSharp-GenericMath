I got hired back on part-time (during the school year) after my internship. Chances of getting a full-time offer after graduation?
Pretty much title. I had an internship over the summer that went well and they now have me back working part time during the school year. Would they do this if they weren't planning on keeping me around? They're going through a merger right now so it seems like they could use the extra hands. How common is it to hire interns?
