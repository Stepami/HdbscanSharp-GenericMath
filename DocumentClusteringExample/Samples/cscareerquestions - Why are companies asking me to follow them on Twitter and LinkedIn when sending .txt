Why are companies asking me to follow them on Twitter and LinkedIn when sending me rejection emails?
Is this some kind of a cruel joke? "Nah m8 you're not good enough to work for us. But don't be disappointed, we have something else that's equally good: how about you like our page on Twitter? That'd be sweet. That way you'd keep hearing about people who DO work here for the rest of your life."  submitted by /u/throw-away-far-away1 [link] [comments]
