Honest Feedback
So I have spent 2 years in school so far, pursuing a BA, and feel a little out of place. I've passed my courses, and without cheating (mainly by hard work), but I often implement very unoptimized solutions to problems. I cannot create a hashmap in C or Java. In life itself, I am very illogical and unfocused-the opposite of a programmer. For example, I had to take out the trash, and I started carrying the bin instead of the bags. I felt some comfort seeing "programming is the new blue collar job" article because i sometimes feel like a woodworker when programming-but then I saw that most programmers viewed it negatively. I like to try things out, print out what is happening, and then revise. I often come up with rough solutions and modify my plans as I code. I use google very often syntax. I'm great with loops, arrays, etc, but weak on higher-level stuff. I like to do tutorials, and am starting a side project. Is this normal?  submitted by /u/1883456 [link] [comments]
