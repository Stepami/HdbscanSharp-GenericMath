My experience interviewing at a no-name company
Since many of the posts here often revolve around large companies with recognizable names, I thought I might give a little perspective on an interview process I had with a small no-name company. The company has about 20 developers and is located on the east coast in a low cost of living city. I have nearly 3 years of dev experience, but I graduated with my Bachelors in Information Systems last year. The interview was for a general Software Engineer position. First interview was over phone. I was asked increasingly harder questions about OOP, recursion, multi-threading, and finally a question about how many times an array would need to be accessed when searching for a value. My second interview was over skype, where I shared my screen and wrote code out in a text editor after they verbally asked the questions. I was asked the following questions: Create a function to determine whether a not a string is a substring anagram of another string. (ex: doggone, god)  Create a function that returns the factorial of the number being passed in.  Fizz Buzz  Create a function that determines if a value exists in a binary search tree.   I haven't received an offer, but I do expect one based on the positive feedback from my interviewers. I'm happy to answer any questions as long as it doesn't involve specifics about the company. Hopefully this is some useful information for those not trying for Big 4 style companies.  submitted by /u/csnonamethrowaway [link] [comments]
