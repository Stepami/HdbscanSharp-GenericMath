Renege internship offer with signing bonus?
I think I'll get downvotes for this question, but I really don't have any other resources besides this subreddit. So I got an internship offer from a big, old (non tech) corporate. The offer is decent, and with a signing bonus. The thing is since this is still early in the recruiting reason, I'm aiming for better (and tech) companies, i.e. Big N, but I don't want to take the risk of not having an internship next summer. Is it possible to not accepting the signing bonus or some sort, so that I will be able to renege later if a better offer comes? I think that once I accept the signing bonus, I cannot renege, right?  submitted by /u/cscareerquestions_me [link] [comments]
