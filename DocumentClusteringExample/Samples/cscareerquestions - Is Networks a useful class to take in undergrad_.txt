Is Networks a useful class to take in undergrad?
Hi, I'm a junior majoring in CS and it's time I chose which classes I'm going to be taking next semester. I have pretty much decided, but I am unsure about one class: Networks. From the course description: Architecture of computer networks and network protocols, protocol layering, reliable transmission, congestion control, flow control, naming and addressing, unicast and multicast routing, network security, network performance widely used protocols such as Ethernet, wireless LANs, IP, TCP, and HTTP.  Now, from the sound of it there is little programming in this class, and it's more hardware-focused. I would say I am more interested in the software parts of CS, but this is one of the recommended courses in my department. If anyone's taken a similar class, have you ever used the information you learned here for anything? Would you say it's been useful? Thanks.  submitted by /u/HexadecimalCowboy [link] [comments]
