Columbus Crew SC: What's going on, and how you can help
#SaveTheCrew www.savethecrew.com A brief history The Columbus Crew were founded in June 1994, as the first MLS club to join the league, playing their first match in April 1996 . The Crew were, in their earliest days, known as “America’s Hardest Working Team,” as clearly displayed in their original logo. Columbus is also home to the United States’ first soccer-specific stadium. Columbus Crew Stadium (since renamed for sponsor MAPFRE) was opened in may 1999 to a roaring sell-out crowd, and has since taken a place among the most important grounds in US Soccer. In the last 3 World Cup qualification cycles, Columbus has hosted the home fixture vs. Mexico, among the biggest possible qualifiers in CONCACAF. The black and gold have enjoyed years of mixed success, with the first of their higher achievements coming in 2002 with a US Open Cup victory, with the tournament later being named for Columbus’s first owner, Lamar Hunt. The club has since made multiple playoff appearances, winning the MLS Cup in 2008 in Los Angeles, in a 3-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls. The goals in this, the most memorable match for many Crew fans no doubt, were scored by three players widely considered to be club legends— striker Alejandro Moreno, center back Chad Marshall, and right back Frankie Hejduk, with all the strings pulled by Guillermo Barros Schelloto, current Boca Juniors manager, and held by many as the greatest Columbus Crew player ever. In 2004, 2008 and 2009, The Black and Gold won three MLS Supporter’s shield (most points in the season) titles, during a period (2002-2009) in which they won more trophies than any other club in Major League Soccer. In the years since the first and only title, the Crew have made multiple playoff appearances, hosting the 2015 final, in which they were defeated by the Portland Timbers. The Crew play their final match of the 2017 season tomorrow afternoon against New York City FC, with the playoffs beginning in the coming weeks. The current situation In 2013, Anthony Precourt and his firm, Precourt Sports Ventures (PSV) purchased the Columbus Crew for $68,000,000. The deal came with widespread excitement among Columbus Crew fans, with many of us fearing that the previous ownership had lost interest in developing The Crew into a truly great club. With new signings, a new manager in Gregg Berhalter, and playoff contention, there seemed to be few negatives both on the field and off, as PSV secured naming rights for MAPFRE Stadium (formerly Columbus Crew Stadium), a number of partnerships with local restaurants and bars, and new sponsorships for stadium areas, renovations to parking lots and other facilities. Concerns festered among a portion of fans that Precourt, an outsider (from California), would have little connection to the Columbus/Ohio community, and that a move of the club could be on the cards, following the news that an ‘out clause’ had been included in the purchase deal, in which Precourt agreed not to move the club anywhere for 10 years, EXCEPT for Austin, Texas. This week, those fears were realized in a way none of us could have prepared for. On October 17, Precourt announced in this statement, following previous reports, that he and his firm were exploring the option of moving our club, MLS’s first, with the United States’ first soccer-specific stadium, to Austin, Texas. In the past, MLS has made attempts to block moves such as these, leading them to be exceedingly rare compared to other US leagues. However, Don Garber, MLS commissioner, expressed his view in the statement I linked above, claiming that he can more or less understand the reasoning to rob a city of a historic club. In the days since, Anthony Precourt has tweeted about taking responsibility for the situation he “put all of us” in, despite refusing refunds of 2018 season tickets (with payments due just days before his announcement), and his firm being clearly involved in running the “MLS2ATX” campaign, as evidenced here. Note “All Rights Reserved— Precourt Sports Ventures” at the bottom of the page. This domain, as well as the associated Instagram and twitter pages, were all created in August, leading many to believe this was a premeditated move by Crew SC ownership. Why should you care? As the mission statement says on www.savethecrew.com, “WE WANT TO JOIN WITH SOCCER FANS WORLDWIDE who love their club and who believe that the beautiful game belongs to the world's communities and its spirit cannot just be uprooted. We vehemently stand against any such move because IF IT CAN HAPPEN IN COLUMBUS, IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.” As has been seen in similar situations, like that of Wimbledon FC in the not-so-distant past, moves such as these strip communities of their ties to their clubs, leaving the most loyal of their fans to pick up the pieces. It is for the good of US (and world) soccer to prevent moves like these from being allowed by those who profit from them. Enabling moves like this risks undermining some of the history that a young league like MLS has built up, and which gives it legitimacy in the eyes of soccer fans around the world. By allowing the league’s OLDEST club to be uprooted in this way, what precedent does this set for other owners? How can you help? The easiest way you can get involved, no matter where or who you are, is to show your support on social media using the hashtag #SaveTheCrew. This will give you all the updates you could possibly need, and show just how important this cause is to not only Columbus Crew fans, but to soccer fans on a larger scale. The current understanding is that fans can influence the outcome of this situation by putting as much pressure as possible on MLS Owners, who will have to vote whether or not to support the relocation. This will be the first in a number of steps we can take toward keeping OUR club and OUR history where it belongs— Columbus, Ohio. By checking and/or registering your email with www.savethecrew.com, you can access a list of Columbus Crew SC’s sponsors along with their contact information, as well as a list of contacts for MLS Owners and their offices, as well as the front offices of other clubs. The movement can also be followed @Save_the_Crew on twitter. Finally, if YOU are going to a game any time soon, and your supporters group has any interest in supporting our cause, banners supporting the “Save the Crew” message can be requested (and will be provided for free) at www.savethecrew.com. Gaining exposure is vital for this campaign, as we, the members of the worldwide soccer family, must stand together to fight injustices such as these.
