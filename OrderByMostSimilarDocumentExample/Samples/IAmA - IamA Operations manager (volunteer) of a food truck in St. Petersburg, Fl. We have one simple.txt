IamA Operations manager (volunteer) of a food truck in St. Petersburg, Fl. We have one simple mission, spread love! We donate a meal to the needy for every sandwich we sell. AMA!
My short bio: Hello all you beautiful folks! We love you! We are currently on location at a local brewery with some down time. We are a non-profit group that feeds those less fortunate and spread love to all those he need it at the same time. I have spent 15 years in the hospitality industry, from bartender to sous chef, and as of recently, operations manager of a hotel. I quit the industry to pursue higher education, swearing to never work in the industry again. So here I am, volunteering in the industry. But rather then being stressed and depressed, I'm doing something that makes me happy and feels good. We know how much love you can spread Reddit, y'all are capable of amazing things so we need your help, anything, even if it's just following us on Instagram or Facebook!
