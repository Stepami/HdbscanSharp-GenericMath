AI Academy from Intel heard about this on a TWIML podcast.
Im starting to dive into machine learning and found Intel's AI academy in the podcast. I checked it out and am starting to work through week 1, into to machine learning. What I like about it You download the material and just follow the instructions to get set up. Super easy. The courses are given in Jupyter(sp) Notebook where you can either code up the examples in your own script or right on the course material. They give a PDF with pretty easy to follow along with slides and in the notebook, there are questions and exercises. All Data sets are provided for you  Cons, There are no lectures (As far as I know) and they expect you know programming and mathematics as most courses do. I personally like not having the lecture as it makes it a little easier to just stop and think about what I need to learn or if something comes up it's a little easier to just open back up a PDF then start watching a lecture. Id figured I share, it's nice to have something that is not a MOOC. Sorry if this has been posted.
