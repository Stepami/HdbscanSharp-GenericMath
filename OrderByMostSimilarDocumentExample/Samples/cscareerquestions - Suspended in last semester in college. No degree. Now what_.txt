Suspended in last semester in college. No degree. Now what?
I go to a top 10 university and was suspended for 2.5 years for allegedly hacking into a school system and altering grades. I have maintained my innocence, and they have ZERO evidence that the hack was done by me. However, they believe the professor's word over me so based on that alone they suspended me. If they actually had evidence they would have kicked me out. I'm not going to get into further details, but we are going to try to sue the university for this. Now for my situation. I was TWO CLASSES short of graduating. However because of my situation I will not have my degree for at least another 2.5+ years. So I really have 2 options then: transfer to another university and try to graduate < 2 years, OR try to find a full-time good paying job... I want to try the second option, but how open would software employers be to hiring a suspended college student with no degree like me? I have the skillset and engineering skills, but no degree. Please, help me.  submitted by /u/50k_wall [link] [comments]
