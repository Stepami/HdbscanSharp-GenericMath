Face hallucination for video surveillance
I have recently been looking into super-resolution techniques that apply specifically to faces ("face hallucination"). Those take noisy or low-resolution images and convert them into high-resolution images exploiting prior knowledge and a learned model from a face dataset. I came across a recent CVPR paper that seems to have obtained very good results and improved the state-of-the-art. The produced images are visually very realistic and seem to approximate the ground truth high-resolution images very well. My question is: could such techniques be applied to problems like face recognition/verification. How realistic is it to expect a super-resolved face image to improve the performance of face recognition algorithms? In the end, information can't be added to the original noisy, low-resolution image, right? What is really happening is actually a fancy interpolation exploiting the prior knowledge from the learned (deep) model. Any opinions/experiences?  submitted by /u/chronosynclastic_inf [link] [comments]
