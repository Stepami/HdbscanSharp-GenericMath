What do you think of Stack Overflow's Salary Calculator?
How accurate do you think it is in your area? Would you trust the median percentile when asking for raises? I work in Atlantic Canada for a local company and it can be hard to get a read on salaries around here. SO says me and my coworkers are being paid below median.  submitted by /u/Vok250 [link] [comments]
