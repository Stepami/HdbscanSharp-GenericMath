LPT: If you see a family at an event taking pictures of each other then offer to take a group/family photo that includes all of them. It's always super appreciated.
Many people don't think to do it at the time or are too embarrassed to approach others and ask.  submitted by /u/kenkellyjunior [link] [comments]
