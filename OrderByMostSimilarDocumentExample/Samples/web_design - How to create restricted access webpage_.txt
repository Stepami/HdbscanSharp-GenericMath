How to create restricted access webpage?
I am currently working on a product that is web-based and will be available to people via a website that I am creating. My question is, is it possible to have a URL that is available only to those people that have purchased my product? For example, the problem I would imagine is: if I send someone a link in an email after purchase, what's to stop that person from forwarding the link to the information to all of his/her friends for free? If it helps, I am currently using Squarespace and have a good amount of experience with that program. Please help! Thank you!  submitted by /u/IronRx [link] [comments]
