Cloud based project: Need help and suggestions!
Hi, I'm a final year engineering student working on a cloud based project. The basic gist of it is to record a Livestream(DVR), store it in a cloud which can then be viewed by an Android device in an on demand basis. My questions are as follows, How can I host my own cloud server? (Softwares/Services etc..) Which language/API should I use for coding the DVR to cloud storage part? Any specific universal encoding video formats that can help me record from any device and then store it in a cloud? How can I go about transferring the live stream from the cloud to the Android device with minimal latency? Any security measures to be taken? All comments are greatly appreciated, thank you guys!  submitted by /u/shanks5296 [link] [comments]
