Please change Ana's ult voiceline to "I have empowered you, attack!" for her halloween legendary skin
I know everyone is busy talking about her buff, but I really want to hear her "Alchemical Boost" voicelines outside of Junkenstein's Revenge. If it's not too much to ask for, I think her other Junkenstein interactions also fit well with her legendary. It'll be awesome to hear her say "Burn!" when you nade an enemy, or "Good night." when you land a sleep dart.  submitted by /u/CrumbleThorn [link] [comments]
