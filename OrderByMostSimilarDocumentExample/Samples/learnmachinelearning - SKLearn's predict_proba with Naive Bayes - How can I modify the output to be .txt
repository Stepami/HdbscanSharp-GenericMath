SKLearn's predict_proba with Naive Bayes - How can I modify the output to be more easily understood?
Hello, I recently completed a small project where I got to toy around with SKLearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in Python. I had to present my findings and during the presentation I was asked if it were possible to see how confident the classifier was when making it's predictions. I was aware of the predict_proba() function but I had not actually used it. So, now I'm taking a look and the probabilities it returns are extremely small (as I would expect). It would be much better if I could some how transform these probabilities onto a scale that ranges from 0 to 100%. Any ideas how I would go about this?  submitted by /u/SteveDougson [link] [comments]
