TIFU by trying to save a package of sweets.
So, this happened about six years ago. To make this clear, I live in a country where it's every boys dream to own a moped/scooter once it's legal to drive one (at the age of 15). So of course I had one. I hade something similar to this, which sort of had a "glove compartment" in front of your knees, so you could store various things while traveling. So this is where it all starts. I've been riding around town with friends (I grew up in a smaller town with a population of less than 10k) and decide that it's time to head home. We'd just been at a convenience store buying some sweets and such. I decide it's a it too hot to wear my sweater so I cram it down the glove compartment, followed by my phone and a package of sweets (opened). Say goodbye to my friends and rode off into the sunset. To get home I took a shortcut, which I usually use, which takes me over a smaller hill with a gravel path. Starting to see where this is going? Did I mention the path was quite bumpy? At about the peak of the path I drive over quite a big bump and time kinda slows down while I see my precious package of sweets fly out of my glove department. With a natural reflex, I quickly let go of the steering wheel with one hand to catch the package, which led to me completely turning the steering wheel 90 degrees, causing me to fly over it. Luckily I manage to catch myself with my hands and don't get too badly hurt. I lay there for a few seconds before slowly getting back on my now scratched scooter, while slowly and shamefully going home. I got a few marks on my knees, but worst damage occurred on the palm of my hands.
