Does physics limit superintelligent AI?
After Singularity has been achieved, the capabilities of AI will be grow beyond human comprehension. But will the fundamental constants of our universe, like the speed of light, Planck's constant, gravitational constant etc, pose a limit to the capabilities of AI? For instance, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be stored in a given volume, called the Bekenstein bound. There are also other fundamental limits of computation. Would superintelligent AI be limited by these physical limits or would it find a way around these since it is superintelligent?  submitted by /u/sudeepraja [link] [comments]
