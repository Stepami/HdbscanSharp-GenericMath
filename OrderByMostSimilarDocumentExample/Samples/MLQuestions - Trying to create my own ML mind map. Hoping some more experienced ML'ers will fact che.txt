Trying to create my own ML mind map. Hoping some more experienced ML'ers will fact check me? [xpost /r/Machinelearning]
I'm not really happy with the mind maps I've been able to find on Google, most of them are algorithm based. I want to make a good one that is problem/solution domain based. Do I have this right for my top level nodes? Here is where I am headed so far: https://imgur.com/gallery/CugcS My questions/doubts about what I have so far are:   Is my starting point below generally correct? e.g. no high level subclass is missing, and everything presented as a subclass deserves to be here?  is Hybrid learning always just a combination of supervised and unsupervised? Or, are there real examples of other hybrid models (e.g. 'reinforcement' and 'supervised', etc.). I know theoretically we can combine any methods...I'm looking for what's real/applied/demonstrable today.  does Reinforcement learning belong at this high level, or is it actually a subset of one of the others (or one I've omitted)?     Machine Learning 1.1 Supervised (uses labelled data to train and validate) 1.2 Unsupervised (uses unlabeled data, or ignores labels if they are present) 1.3 Semi-supervised (uses partially labelled (mostly unlabeled) data) 1.4 Hybrid (combines a supervised method and an unsupervised method) 1.5 Reinforcement Learning (uses data from the environment)     Thank you!  submitted by /u/ezeeetm [link] [comments]
