Beware, anyone using Mailgun with an https website
Like me you might have opted to make your website HSTS. Like me you might have recently added includeSubDomains to your HSTS header. Like me you might be completely oblivious to the fact that this is probably killing your mailgun link tracking.  But yes, your "email.mg.mydomain.com" CNAME that you'll have set up when you enabled click tracking in mailgun will no longer work. Users' browsers will take the rewritten http://email.mg.mydomain.com links and silently change them to https://email.mg.mydomain.com, which since it's a CNAME to mailgun.com then doesn't work. The really weird thing is while the links die in Chrome on my laptop (they time out eventually), I'm still getting plenty of clicks in my mailgun logs. A bit of experimentation seems to show that while Chrome in windows 10 definitely wants to rewrite them from http to https, Chrome on my Pixel XL (fully updated) doesn't seem to care. But everything I can find online tells me that android Chrome does support HSTS, so who knows what's going on there. Anyway, I had no idea this was a potential problem until an hour ago, so I thought I'd try to spread the word, I can't be the only one that hadn't realised this would be a problem when enabling HSTS...! Can I? :)  submitted by /u/codemunky [link] [comments]
