Building a MTG Card Recommender
So, I'm looking for advice on a good algorithm for generating card recommendations for Magic the Gathering Decks. My goal is to use just the card database as my datasource, and then ideally feed the model a list of test cards that it returns the top 100 or so cards it thinks are most relevant to that card. For anyone familiar with MTG, I'm aiming this around the EDH format, where you choose a card that is the commander for a deck, and it's color identity and abilities normally help build a theme for the deck. My first thought was something like k-means clustering to create clusters of cards and then feed it the test cards to see where the card lands, but I'm not certain how to factor in multivariate features into a k-means (still fiddling with sklearn to try and figure that out. I also thought that CNNs might be a good approach to try and have a neural network learn relationships between cards. Any advice on algorithms or obvious things I'm missing would be greatly appreciated. For reference, a single card in Magic has several features: {'layout': 'normal', 'name': 'General Tazri', 'manaCost': '{4}{W}', 'cmc': 5, 'colors': ['White'], 'type': 'Legendary Creature â€” Human Ally', 'supertypes': ['Legendary'], 'types': ['Creature'], 'subtypes': ['Human', 'Ally'], 'text': 'When General Tazri enters the battlefield, you may search your library for an Ally creature card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.\n{W}{U}{B}{R}{G}: Ally creatures you control get +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the number of colors among those creatures.', 'power': '3', 'toughness': '4', 'imageName': 'general tazri', 'colorIdentity': ['W', 'U', 'B', 'R', 'G']} I think the ones of most use to me are the color identity (in Magic, there are underlying themes to each color of spell), card ability text, mana cost, and card types.  submitted by /u/anubis_dragoon [link] [comments]
