WP + Woocommerce guided tours booking from a calendar - best options?
A client wants to sell tours with a limited max amount of people per tour on woocommerce. The process should be as follows: The visitor picks a tour/safari they like. They are taken to a page that shows details, and on that page there is a booking calendar monthly view that shows the dates + times when the tour in question can be booked. After choosing the date, they are taken to checkout with their chosen date and they pay, this is standard woocommerce stuff. The tours must be easy to manage in backend by my client. It would be extremely good if they can just create a "product" with its own product page etc, then just input the dates + times (tours take few hours max.) The calendar should be translatable by editing specific calendar files and moving them to a separate folder to prevent overwrite when plugin is updated. (or some other method of translating works too, if they exist...) My question: which Woocommerce plugins can achieve exactly this? Are there any cheap but reliable choices? Thanks for your help!  submitted by /u/Tygsman [link] [comments]
