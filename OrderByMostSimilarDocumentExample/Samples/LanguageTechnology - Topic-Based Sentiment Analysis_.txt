Topic-Based Sentiment Analysis.
Ideas for vectorizing Twitter topics: I am building a Sentiment Analysis model for Twitter. My dataset contains a message(tweet), the given topic (e.g. stephen king) and the sentiment. My target is to get word embedding for messages and topics and then pass them both thought 2 lstm network with shared weight and concatenate the two outputs. I am still at the beginning. I use Social Tokenizer (ekphrasis) for the messages and i am thinking what will it be o good Tokenizer for the topic part. No tokenizing will be necessary cause I want the full topic to be one vector. Sorry if it sound strange to some. I am new in NLP and ML.  submitted by /u/SmokinAce88 [link] [comments]
