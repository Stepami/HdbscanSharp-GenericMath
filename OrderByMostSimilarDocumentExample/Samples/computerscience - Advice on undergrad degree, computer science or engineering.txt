Advice on undergrad degree, computer science or engineering
I have my Associates degree. I love computer games and learning new things about the human body and mind. I am 26, work full time so it took me roughly 3 and 1/2 years to get my associates at the local community college. I am now currently at university and need to choose my major. I am stuck between B.S. in computer science and mechanical engineering. I really enjoy mathematics and physics, and applying these into the real world. I took my first coding class last semester and really enjoyed it. I love the logics of computer science. As well as being able to build something and testing it on the spot. I enjoy the mass amount of information and the challenge C.S. brings. But my typing speed is terrible at roughly 20 words per minute and I have to look at my keys. I feel like I have this fallacy about what a computer science job will actually be and feel like i am not good at even truly understanding how computers work(this scares me). Since I love applying math and physics into the real world, Engineering seems like it would be logical. I just feel lost in trying to decide what to pick, it is making me depressed and I have to decide soon as next semester I will be starting into my major courses.  submitted by /u/MrMiz321 [link] [comments]
