[D] Just finished Andrew Ng's Stanford course. Is there another theory/math heavy resource to go from here (not looking for anything too practical ie programming language heavy)
I'm not looking for anything too practical or programming heavy at the moment as I already have a bit of experience being a machine learning hobbyist. A while back I asked if there's a good resource for ML learning hobbyist with low ML theory background but strong math( differential equations, stats, linear algebra) background. The top recommendation was Andrew Ng's Stanford course and I got to say it really hit the spot. As someone with the correct math background and practical experience with ML, the course was really fantastic for me for getting the theory, and as I am about to wrap up the series I'm a bit sad about finishing it, sort of like when you finish a book you're really into. I am wondering if a machine learning course to go from here, something like a continuation of Andrew Ng's course, which is heavy in math and theory. I've been looking at some of the other courses/resources/books out there, it seems like the most prevalent ones are those that heavy in the programming implementations of machine learning, and light in theory/math. I don't mind a course that is practical and programming, but I want to continue to strengthen my math/theory background is I already have a bit of experience on the practical implementation side.  submitted by /u/TeslaCarBot [link] [comments]
