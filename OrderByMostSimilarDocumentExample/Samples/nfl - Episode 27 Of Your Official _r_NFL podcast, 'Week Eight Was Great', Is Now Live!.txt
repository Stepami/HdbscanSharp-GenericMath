Episode 27 Of Your Official /r/NFL podcast, 'Week Eight Was Great', Is Now Live!
In conjunction with the mods of r/NFL we are proud to announce the latest episode of this subreddit's one and only, official podcast! In this week's episode, hosts Chris and Jeff "The Riz" Risdon discuss the biggest games of the past week and their implications. We talk about how badly the Dolphins performed again, and how the Ravens really messed up some folk's fantasy games this week. We also break down one of the more exciting games of the year in which the Seahawks took down the Texans at the Clink, chat up the Bills and their stronger than expected first half of the season, and talk about the Broncos and Chiefs game including the woes at the quarterback position in Denver. Next, we break down the latest player news including the happenings from the trade deadline. Josh Gordon's conditional reinstatement starts things off, but we talk Ezekiel Elliot and his suspension, Kelvin Benjamin's trade, Jay Ajayi's trade to Philadelphia (and we give the Eagles the props they deserve for their season so far), get down on Jimmy Garoppolo, and talk about the devastating injury to Zach Miller. All that and more is covered in "This Week In Reddit". We also share our "locks and shocks" predictions for the coming action of Week 9, which features Chris falling back to earth a bit but still leading in the standings, while the Riz continues to play his slow and steady game and has a distinct chance to even things up this week. Let us know what you think about the show by commenting in the podcast thread in the subreddit, or by leaving us a voice mail message via Skype at: Reddit NFL Podcast, or giving us a call at (858) 345-4NFL.
