I created a page where you can download icons/illustrations for free, need some help though
Hey Guys I am working on a new project. On my personal page http://lukaszadam.com/ I would like to offer free icons and illustrations I have made. Similar to the free stock photo pages (like pexels). I am just starting out and I know the stuff I have made is not always good, however I practise every day and I am sure in the future, there will be some icons/illustration which one of you guys might find helpful for your projects. At the moment you can just right click and save the illustration if you like to. However I would like to make this more professionell. Not quiet sure how to do that since I am using jekyll and github. Should I host the files somewhere like dropbox and then include the link? Or should I just offer direct downloading? I remember seeing someone who offered similar stuff like this one and on an external page, people could download the stuff for free or if they wanted to, they could pay whatever they like. Any one of guys know such a thing? One other thing is, is this legal to create illustrations like the storm trooper? I mean, I do not get any money from this but am I even allowed to upload stuff like this? (same with the iphone cable). EDIT: Oh and one more question, if there is someone out there who could invite me to dribble that would be most greatly appreciated!  submitted by /u/tinaclark90 [link] [comments]
