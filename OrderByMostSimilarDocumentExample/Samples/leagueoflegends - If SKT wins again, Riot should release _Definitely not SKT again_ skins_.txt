If SKT wins again, Riot should release "Definitely not SKT again" skins.
Like the blitzcrank skin with mustaches and overcoats to hide their team logos. Maybe the recall animation has an upside down SKT, etc. They could be TKS, a Venezualan flex queue team that overcame great odds to win it all. Any other ideas? Thoughts? Concerns for me?  submitted by /u/MrAjax36 [link] [comments]
