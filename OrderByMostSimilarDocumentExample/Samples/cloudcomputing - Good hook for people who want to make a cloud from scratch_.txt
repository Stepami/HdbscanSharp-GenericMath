Good hook for people who want to make a cloud from scratch?
Edit: book* of course the thing I forgot to double check is the header which has the typo I just want book suggestions, I am finding mixed reviews online and it's not clear if the book will actually help me or not. I don't just want to take an abstract concept and sit down and think about how to do it, because I can over think things, and would like to just have a book that will give coding examples. I plan to use this on a raspberry pi and make my own personal cloud. Thanks! Also yes I know there is free software but im not learning anything and I want to try making my own  submitted by /u/Chieve [link] [comments]
