TIFU by playing with Mace
This happened last night, I was test firing a new Mace(R) Maximum strength pepper spray I’d just bought from a sports store, (I have several large dogs, the owners of which “forget” to use a leash or even supervise when their dog and I finished firing after putting it through quite a few different scenarios. (Being attacked from in front, attacked from behind, “just in case” situations.) I go inside to set it down, and I rub my eye with with my hand (not the hand I was holding the mace in my right hand, but my left hand.) i ended up getting mace in my eye. (I can’t wash it out at the time, I’m not inside yet.) In the dark, I grope around and end up tripping on the short step stairs leading to the door, and I ended up falling due to it being dark and my blurred vision, hitting my head on the door. TL;DR: I was screwing around with extra strength pepper spray and rubbed my eye, somehow getting mace into my eye blurring my vision until I fell down a flight of stairs and hit my head on the door I was trying to open.  submitted by /u/Shawnthewolf12 [link] [comments]
