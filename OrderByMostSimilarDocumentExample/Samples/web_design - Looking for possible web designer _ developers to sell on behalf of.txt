Looking for possible web designer / developers to sell on behalf of
Hi r/web_design, hope this is allowed here! I have a sales company based in the UK and we are looking to start a new campaign selling websites. We would find the clients and arrange everything, you would just need to design and build the website. If you are interested, just shoot me a PM with some of your work history, rates etc  submitted by /u/cbizz1 [link] [comments]
