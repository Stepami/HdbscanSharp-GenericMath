Working with GridView and ObjectDataSource in ASP.NET
First of all, apologies if this isn't a place to ask questions. Let me know and I'll delete the post. I'm trying to bind ObjectDataSource to a GridView and perform edit operation on the rows from grid view. This is my GridView             And this is the ObjectDataSource :          Displaying the data in the gridview is working as intended but editing is where the problem. This is the UpdateValue method :  public static void UpdateValue(AttributeValue val) { Debug.WriteLine("Type is >> " + val.Id + " >>" + val.Value + "<<"); }  The problem here is I'm only getting the old values in val object. Meaning the updated values are not set in the val object. Also, AttributeValue class is autogenerated as a model from database if that is important. What am I doing wrong?  submitted by /u/IndianSpongebob [link] [comments]
