TIFU by backing up our car.
TIFU by backing up our car(2004 Dodge Durango) into our garage door. This happened about 40 minutes ago. I just got my permit on Monday and I’ve been excited to drive and it’s a blast. My dad wanted me to back out the car outta the shop. I jumped on the offer and went to go do it. Well. I over complicated it and turned the wrong way because it made sense in the moment but not anymore, and I turned to early too. I ended up hitting the front driver tire into the side of the garage door railings. I quickly pulled forward, straightened out, backed up again. This time doing the right thing and made it out. I ripped up the trim of it and put a huge dent it the Durango. It also felt like it was grinding when I was turning the shell but I might of been imaging it with all the panic and the imminent doom ahead. My dad was pissed off which is a given. My mom kept saying it’ll be okay and shit happens. But I just got my permit. I know that doesn’t mean I know everything there is and all that. But I should be able to back up a fucking car. TL;DR: Just got my drivers permit. Dad wanted me to back up our car. Ended up hitting the garage door rails with it.  submitted by /u/DoggoDoggoBorkBork [link] [comments]
