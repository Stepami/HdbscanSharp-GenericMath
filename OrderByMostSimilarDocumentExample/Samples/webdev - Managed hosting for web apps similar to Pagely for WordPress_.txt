Managed hosting for web apps similar to Pagely for WordPress?
Hi! I just made a website using Gatsby and formcarry and then pushed it online with Netlify. It's really fast, but Netlify is only for static websites. I want to build some web apps, but I don't want to manage a VPS from DO, etc myself. I can set one up and I can probably manage it, but I am trying to focus on the coding part (I am still have to learn a lot) before DevOps. Are there any hosts that offer what Pagely or Kinsta offer for WordPress, but for web apps/interactive websites? Should I use a Docker host? Thanks!  submitted by /u/ClearedFram3 [link] [comments]
