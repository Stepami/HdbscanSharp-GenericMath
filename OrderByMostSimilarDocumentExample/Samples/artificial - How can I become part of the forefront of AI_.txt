How can I become part of the forefront of AI?
My situation: Bachelor's in Computer Science, though I'm out of practice. I have nothing tying me down anywhere. Still fairly young. I'm rich enough to retire so money is not an issue. I can move anywhere. I can work for free or go to school or spend time studying. Basically, I can do anything. What would be the best way to get involved with programming or working with AI? I'm having trouble finding information on what the top companies are. Do I need an advanced degree? I would STRONGLY prefer not to go back to school, if possible. If I do go back to school, what are the top AI programs? What are the big organizations and meetups? Again, I can't find much about it in the city I live (Chicago.) There are some small generic meetups, but that's it.  submitted by /u/SolomonMassey [link] [comments]
