Songs you wish the rest of the world knew
I would like to compile a playlist of songs you (Reddit) wish the rest of the world heard because they have redeeming qualities such as depth, emotionally moving, or what have you. This is not a popularity contest so every song mentioned will be included as long as some description is provided to explain what redeeming qualities the song has. I will make playlists for Spotify, Deezer and Tidal. Now Go! EDIT[1]: If you have Spotify I'm making the list here and then I'll convert it for other services https://open.spotify.com/user/ronaldmunodawafa/playlist/2MB4QhAQtkzpNi0NUPpR9T  submitted by /u/OwlieMoon [link] [comments]
