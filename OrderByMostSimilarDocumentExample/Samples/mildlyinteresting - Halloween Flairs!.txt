Halloween Flairs!
Once again it's not long until halloween. That means it's time to get mildly spooky up in here. From now until Halloween, everyone here will receive one out of seventeen possible mildly spooky Halloween flairs! You don't have to choose a flair in the sidebar. They're automatically given through CSS (based on the last letter/number of your username). Thus, you must have our CSS enabled to view them. All icons are from icons8. Enjoy.  submitted by /u/abe699 [link] [comments]
