Should I be applying for a Jr. vs Mid-level position when I have ~4yrs of experience to find a job?
I had to quit my last job due to personal reasons involving my family. I've been unemployed since only picking up small freelance projects on Upwork or trying to find volunteering opportunities in the mean time. Its been almost 6 months now since I've had a full time position. I have submitted applications for Front End/Full Stack Javascript Roles. Sometimes I hear back, sometimes I don't. When I do hear back I get interviews but I freeze up during some of the algorithm problems where I get the traditional "thank you" follow up with a rejection. I'm beginning to wonder if I am not apply for the right roles. I do have experience but I don't know I "qualify" for a Jr. role vs a Mid-level. I have a personal website and I'm cleaning up my portfolio. Any advice or suggestions would be very helpful?  submitted by /u/shakyink [link] [comments]
