[Everything] Season 1: Ep 8, Seaon 7: Ep6
Alright, so the whole point of S7 E6 is to go and get a Wight to bring back to KL. In season 1 Ep 8 did the wight that attacked LC Mormont get resurrected as a wight or just wake up over time. There is no sign that the Night King resurrected this man into a wight so how did he wake up? If all that dies beyond the wall get resurrected as wight could they not have just grabbed some of the dead redcoats that were killed by the zombie bear?  submitted by /u/getbuckets419 [link] [comments]
