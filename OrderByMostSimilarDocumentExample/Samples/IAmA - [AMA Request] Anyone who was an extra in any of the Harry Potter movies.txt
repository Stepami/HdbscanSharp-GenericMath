[AMA Request] Anyone who was an extra in any of the Harry Potter movies
Been rewatching all the movies and noticed there are a lot of background Hogwarts students, so on the miraculous chance that someone who played one sees this, here are some questions: What was the set like? (If you filmed at the castle, even if not, where did you film & how was it?)  How were Daniel, Emma and Rupert off camera?  Whats your best memory from filming?  Whats your worst memory from filming?  Which movie/what role did you play in?  Did they let you keep the costume and most importantly, which house did your wardrobe set you in?    submitted by /u/DaWylecat [link] [comments]
