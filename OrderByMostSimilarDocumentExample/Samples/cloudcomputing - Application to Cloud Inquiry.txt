Application to Cloud Inquiry
If in wrong subreddit, I apologize. My company is a software manufacturer and our product runs in a typical Client/Server configuration using a SQL database with a service that runs on the machine acting as the "server". This service is responsible for servicing clients, as well as communicating to specific devices over the customers network. The majority of the application is written in VB.NET and we offer a web based client that utilizes IIS. We are interested in offering a hosted solution through a cloud based solution such as AWS or Azure to. What I am looking for is any literature or information on how to take what we have today and transition it to the cloud. I do understand we can spin up a VM, install our application, configure SQL and allow a customer to run the application, but what if we have 100 separate customers that each need access to their own software? Do we need to have that many VM's configured? Would the Docker solution be something we should consider? Thank You.  submitted by /u/bstaley [link] [comments]
