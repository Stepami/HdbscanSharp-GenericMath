An Air Force pilot, a Naval Officer and an Army Private all go to the bathroom
When they come out, the Air Force pilot begins thoroughly washing his hands and says, 'In the Air Force they taught us the importance of good hygiene.' The Naval officer then begins washing his hands using only a small trickle of water and says, 'In the Navy they taught us the importance of good hygiene AND water conservation.' The army private walks straight out without stopping and says, 'In the Army they taught us to not piss on our hands.'  submitted by /u/Beezneez86 [link] [comments]
