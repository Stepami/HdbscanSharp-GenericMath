TIFU by eating candy
Today (about an hour ago), I fucked up by eating some candy. I had a job orientation today and when I got there, I was surprised to see I was the only one there. My seat had some papers, a water bottle, and a little pile of candy. I followed along with the orientation, drank my water, and stuffed the candy in pocket before we went on a store tour. After the orientation, I walked home and decided to pull out the candy from earlier. I picked out my favorite, hard toffee, and popped it in my mouth. Then, my friend called me, so I chewed on the toffee so it wouldn't sound like I was gargling dicks while talking. Bad mistake. It chipped one of my molars. At first, I thought it was just a piece of the toffee, but it felt kinda weird, so I decided to spit it out. And there is was, a good quarter of my tooth. I told my friend that I had just chipped my tooth and we laughed about it. I'm kinda worried. It doesn't hurt or anything, but I don't have insurance and I feel like I can't trust my teeth anymore. TL;DR - I ate some candy and chipped my tooth.  submitted by /u/soundsofjesus [link] [comments]
