TIFU by wrecking my bike
So this just happened two hours ago. I was riding my bike to class on my usual route and I was just on autopilot. Queue the fuck up. I was making a left turn, one that I make almost everyday, and today I decide to lean a little more into the turn than normal. I think once before I leaned too much, so this time I decide to make sure my left pedal is higher, but then for some dumb reason I decide to continue pedaling instead of coasting through the turn. Immediately my bike jumps a bit due to the impact of my left pedal on the ground, but I think it's probably fine and I continue to ride. As I try to go on, my bike just won't go, so I find the closest place to park my bike and leave it to go to class. When I come back an hour and a half later, my back wheel is basically no longer attached. I try my best to put re-attach the wheel, but I still feels a little wonky. So yeah, I screwed up my bike because I felt like leaning a little more than usual today. I am planning to go to some bike repair shop this weekend, but if anyone has any advice, I would gladly accept it. Thank! TL;DR: I was biking to class and my left pedal hit the ground too hard, which caused my back wheel to come off.  submitted by /u/RyanIsADummy [link] [comments]
