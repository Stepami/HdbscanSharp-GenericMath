Hate talking to recruiters
First of all, there is a lot of great recruiters out there, without my recruiter finding me on linkedin, i wouldnt have my current job. Here is my complaint about them, They always try to call for the simpliest things, they are always so eager but have very little influence on the hiring decision, they always try so hard to get to know you on a personal level before the phone screen and they know that phone screens typically screen out 90% of candidates. So 90% of the time you are completely wasting your time. /rantover  submitted by /u/br00grammer [link] [comments]
