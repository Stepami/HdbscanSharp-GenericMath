We’re the creators of #CreepyIP, a celebration of weird and spooky patents and trademarks, AMA!
Every year since 2011, the United State Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has shared intellectual property (IP) found in the deepest and darkest corners of our 200+ year old archives. This Halloween, join our social media team to talk all about #CreepyIP -- from how it got started, to the magic of searching for old patents and trademarks, to what invention artwork gives us the heebie jeebies. The late Laura Larrimore – senior digital strategist Liz ChuuuuUUUUUuuuuuUUUU – social media specialist Paul “Freak Show” Fucito – press secretary Paul “Redrum” Rosenthal – acting chief communications officer Proof: AMA announcement from the official @USPTO account on Twitter Send us your queries!
