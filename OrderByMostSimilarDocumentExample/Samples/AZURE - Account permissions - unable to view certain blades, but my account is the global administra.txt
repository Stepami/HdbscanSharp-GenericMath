Account permissions - unable to view certain blades, but my account is the global administrator
Hi guys. Azure support has proven completely unable to assist me on this, I am hoping someone here has the answer. We inherited a client with an Azure tenant, as well as Office 365. They have different tenant IDs. I am completely unable to open the Azure AAD blade in the Azure portal, I get a permission denied error that says to contact the owner. But... I am the owner. Azure support insisted that this error was because our global admin account shares an email address with O365 account. Against our inclination, we renamed the account to use an outlook.com email address and removed the other domain from the account completely. This made no change in the problem. Unfortunately the people who set up this account did not grant any other admin privileges so we have no other accounts we can use, and Azure support cannot or will not create a new one for us. Does anyone have any ideas? We need to authorize several new users to manage the tenant soon and we're out of ideas. If it helps, the tenant may have been part of a CSP previously, but we have been assured that this is not the case.  submitted by /u/FerengiKnuckles [link] [comments]
