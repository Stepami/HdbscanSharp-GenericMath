SVM with e1071 in R (about cross validation results)
Assuming our model is called m1, from my understanding m1$tot.accuracy is the accuracy from our cross validation, however is there any way to also get other measurements (sensitivity, specificity) from the cross validation? I'm far more interested in the sensitivity than the overall misclassification rate, so it would make sense to choose model based on the cross validation sensitivity, and not the cross validation misclassification rate or accuracy, right? Is there some way to extract this information from an svm object? The closest I could find was m1$fitted and then manually constructing a confusion matrix from this, but this information does not seem to match with the m1$tot.accuracy results, so I'm suspecting those fitted values are not based on the cross validation at all.  submitted by /u/325588 [link] [comments]
