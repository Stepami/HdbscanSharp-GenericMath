what is the cost advantage of a cloud service versus the traditional hosted enterprise server set up?
I am looking for generic numbers for a business case. Can someone here point me to somewhere where I can see some numbers that compare the two scenarios? I know what the cost heads will be and that there will be savings, and efficiencies etc. But I want some hard numbers!  submitted by /u/pocketrocketsingh [link] [comments]
