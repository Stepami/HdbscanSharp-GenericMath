NA needs to unleash their best team.
Top: Hashinshin Mid: Gross Gore Jungle: Tarzand ADC: Tyler1 Support: Clown/Road Coach: Sanjuro Analysts: Reddit It's best we import our supports and cycle them with this bot-lane centric team comp. This truly highlights the best of what NA has to offer, along with a long tradition of importing talent. If NA wants to beat Korean teams they need a comp that can do it on the rift as well as off the rift. I don't think this team has any weakness. C'mon VCs you owe money this is how you win Worlds. EDIT: Reddit Analysts already giving massive input on possible weakness of the mid lane. So like any good NA team, we're importing EU Talent.  submitted by /u/Gosexual [link] [comments]
