Standalone Azure VM without public IP outgoing traffic
Hi, I have a Azure VM server which doesn't have any public IP associated. I am running a process in this server which needs to access ftp service of my client. To achieve this they need to whitelist my VM public IP but the VM doesn't have any public IP or its not behind any NAT/loadbalancer. As per the documentation link https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections#standalone-vm-with-no-instance-level-public-ip-address, Azure translates VM private IP outbound traffic to a public IP address using SNAT. My questions are: 1. can I use this public IP address assigned through SNAT to whitelist my server forever? 2. will it keep changing dynamically? 3. If I restart my VM, will I get a new public IP? Thanks.  submitted by /u/anjana_raghavendra [link] [comments]
