Resources for learning Set Theory
Hi, I started a course in Set Theory this week, and I'm looking for some online resources to complement the lectures (I already read a 2nd order logic course which went quite bad, I have the exam on friday, wish me luck) since I don't want to fail this course too. So do you guys have any books, videos or sites that you could recommend? Thanks.  submitted by /u/NotAronsCat [link] [comments]
