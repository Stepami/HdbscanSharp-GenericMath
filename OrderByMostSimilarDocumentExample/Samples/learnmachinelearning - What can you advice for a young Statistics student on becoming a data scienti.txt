What can you advice for a young Statistics student on becoming a data scientist and/or machine learning engineer?
I'm currently in my second year to get a bachaelors degree in Statistics(I'm from Turkey so I'm not sure what is the equivalent form of my education in other countries. It's a 4 year program and they give you a bachaelors degree). I want to become a data scientist and/or machine learning engineer. Since my teachers are not even familiar with those specialties and also that those are considerably new fields, I can't get much help and I'm not sure what questions I should be asking. I'm thinking of starting to learn R slowly, and maybe work on my German in case I can't find the right master's program in my country. What can you advice?
