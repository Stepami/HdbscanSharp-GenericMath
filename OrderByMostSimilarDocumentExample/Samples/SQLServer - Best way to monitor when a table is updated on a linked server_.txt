Best way to monitor when a table is updated on a linked server.
I have a DB that I connect to but have no control over. My goal is to know when a table has a row added (or alternatively when a column in a different table is updated) to trigger a PS script. Having a job run a query to update a separate table on my side to monitor is doable, but I'd like to have the trigger hit as close as possible to the original table update. Never done this before, so having trouble with what is the best option. Anyone have good direction on this? Very familiar with working with PS if that helps, but not PS with MSSQL. EDIT: For the next guy I guess... What I did was create a view of that table on my side of DB world. It queries for users that have been updated in the last 5 minutes. Then in a PS script I read any rows from that view and dump out an alert message. I'll attach a scheduled task to the script. Very lightweight and simpler than doing all the coding in SQL.  submitted by /u/thegooddoctor-b [link] [comments]
