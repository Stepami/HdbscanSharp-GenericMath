How to choose between offers
First, I'd just like to say thank you to everyone who has already posted about topics like this. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I've got a couple options at the moment. Option 1: Return to a Healthcare IT company for a second internship, and potentially for a full time job afterwards. I worked in Data Science last summer, and would likely do that again this coming summer. Option 2: E-Commerce business in a town that I've never been to, but pays slightly more. I likely wouldn't be doing Data Science work for them, and I'm unsure about full-time positions afterwards. Option 3: Wait to hear back from a couple other companies (one is a big4) to make my decision even more difficult (lol). What are some things you consider when trying to decide between offers? I've looked at salary, housing options, as well as potential for full-time work after the internship. If you have any input, I would love to hear it. Thanks.  submitted by /u/GrasslikeMix [link] [comments]
