Let's talk about what it means to be Not the Onion
The biggest complaint and removal reason we have on nottheonion is oniony. Many people think oniony simply means funny or sounds like satire. While the latter is closer, it really needs to be outrageous enough that at first glance you can't tell if it's fake news or not. A lot of times we wish something was fake news, but sadly it's just become the norm. Frequent Flyer NOT ONIONY posts Trump. Or any other total buffoon/lunatic/showman like Trump: Alex Jones, Kanye, and that ilk. To a lesser extent, just-complete-blowhards & provocateurs like Bill O'Reilly, Al Sharpton, 1b. Actually, most dictators, politicians & religious figures saying dumb shit. It's practically their job.  "Person who was against [thing] gets caught doing [that thing]." It's done, it's common, it's a dead horse, it's a trope.  Similarly, "Firetruck/firehouse catches fire" or "police car gets stolen" or similar. Even if there's strong irony, it's still not "NO WAY MUST BE SATIRE" if it happens all the time.  "Person/kid found [someplace benign like their under their bed] after a huge search party" - same thing, very common. In a case of potential foul play, minutes or seconds count and it's important to use available resources as soon as possible.  Just-punny headlines. If the article doesn't have any ironic/satirical elements itself, a clever headline is almost never enough. 5b. Also just funny words (Uranus) or names (a Vietnamese chap named Long Dong) - it's funny, but it's just a funny name/word, usually refer to /r/offbeat or /r/im14andthisisfunny  Stuff better off in /r/NewsOfTheStupid, or /r/FloridaMan especially dumb criminals. They're painfully not unbelievable anymore. Applies to "caught because they left something somewhere" or "couldn't carjack b/c couldn't drive stick" or "called for ransom on own phone"... Ditto "[act of violence] started with fight over [something stupid like food]" - many of the same story each week, so refer to /r/Offbeat, /r/NewsOfTheStupid, /r/NewsOfTheWeird, /r/FloridaMan or geo equiv, /r/ANormalDayInAmerica, /r/GunsAreCool if ordinary dumbass-"accidental"-shooting one, etc.  People over reacting to news or protesting something dumb. We get it, people that don't like what you don't like are morons.  OMG something totally references an overused joke on reddit lulz XD so random11!1!!   TL;DR: You were probably looking for /r/offbeat all along  submitted by /u/elfa82 [link] [comments]
