I have a question.
I understand why MS killed off Groove, Windows Phone, Band, and several other products. But why did they kill Kinect? Seems like a great product, apart from other products that I mentioned, Kinect is known by consumers, loved it, enjoyed it... Again, why did they kill it?  submitted by /u/seanylim [link] [comments]
