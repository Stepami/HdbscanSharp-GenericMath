I launched Rossella, a Fake News-Fighting web service - AMA!
My short bio: I am K. Alexander Ashe, an entrepreneur and a full stack developer, I created Rossella to fight the fake news epidemic and help people & brands save time tweeting content from trusted sources. I named the service RoSSella because my algorithm it uses RSS feeds to transform fresh news into tweets. Also, a rosella is a parrot, i.e., tweet tweet, birdie, etc. Previous AMAs: Federal Government Whistleblower (HHS/NIH) Trademark Dispute with PNC Bank. tl;dr the case went to the Supreme Court and the company is now called SpendCast. My Proof: My picture w/ the Reddit AMA title, today's date, and my username are on the About section of the Rossella website. Rossella About  submitted by /u/spendology [link] [comments]
