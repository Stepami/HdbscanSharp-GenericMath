A blonde, a brunette and a redhead all die and are supposed to go to heaven
However, they have all sinned in their lives, so they are kept at the base of the 100 step stairway-to-heaven. God comes to them and says "All of you have commited sins that cannot be forgiven, so you must face a trial if you wish to enter heaven. Every step you take on this stairway, I will tell you one joke. If you laugh once, I will send you to Hell" They agree, and begin the trial. The brunette goes first. She manages to stifle her laughs until the fourth step, until she loses it, so God sends her to Hell. The redhead goes after. She can't even make it through one joke without laughing, so God, disappointingly, sends her to Hell. Finally, the blonde goes. Somehow, she doesn't laugh at all at the jokes, managing to take every step easily. However, when she reaches the very last step, before God even says his last joke, she begins laughing hysterically. God waits for her to calm down before asking why she was laughing, and she responds: "Sorry, I just got your first joke"  submitted by /u/billyblueberry [link] [comments]
