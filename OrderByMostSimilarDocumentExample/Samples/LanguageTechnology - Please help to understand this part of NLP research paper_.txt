Please help to understand this part of NLP research paper.
I've been reading a research paper related to Pun Detection task in NLP, and there are some parts that I don't understand. (I'm a noob). LINK: http://aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2005 First in the 3. Heterographic Puns section, I don't understand what it means by separating the context into n-grams and pair them. Is it something like: ('I', 'am', 'a', 'boy') -> ('I', 'am', 'a'), ('am', 'a', 'boy') And I also don't get the following sentence that says: For each of these original n-grams, the corpus is searched for n-grams that are at most one word different. How does this actually work? Second, I don't actually get how the ratio and the score are computed. Don't know what to put in for ||w|| and why we need to subtract 1 / ration from the frequency different. It would be great if anyone could help me understand this.
