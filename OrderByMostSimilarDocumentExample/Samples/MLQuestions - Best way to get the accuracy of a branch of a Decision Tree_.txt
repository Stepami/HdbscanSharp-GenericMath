Best way to get the accuracy of a branch of a Decision Tree?
I'm using scikit-learn1 , and have a bunch of trees already learned, but I want to evaluate the quality of each individual branch using an accuracy score2 . Is there a good way to do this? It's classifying a binary decision, where the feature is either a class, or not a class. 1 Scikit-learn Decision Trees Introduction: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html 2 Accuracy score documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html  submitted by /u/ThomasAger [link] [comments]
