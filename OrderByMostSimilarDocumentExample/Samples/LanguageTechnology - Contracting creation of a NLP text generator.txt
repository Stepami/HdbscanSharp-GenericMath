Contracting creation of a NLP text generator
Hello, I'm looking to contract someone to create a NLP algorithm that generates text based on (or heavily influenced by) a ~175,000 word corpus from a specific writer. I've played around with intro-level sample algorithms and things like Botnik Writer without much success (this isn't anything close to my area of expertise), so I was hoping that I could find someone in this community that would be interested. Ideally this would be something that I could plug a seed into and get X words back, but like I said, I'm not an expert, so I'm flexible on what exactly the end product would look like. Also, I'm more than happy to compensate for the work! Please send me a DM if you're interested or have any questions.  submitted by /u/chronozak [link] [comments]
