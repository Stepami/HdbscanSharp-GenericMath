BA Philosophy, no coding experience.
Hey, guys. I'm looking to become a developer. That'd be rad. I'm currently working in mortgages and I'm not really liking it. Considering that I had an interested in this stuff since high school (I learned how to build web pages n stuff back when CSS2 was the jam), but I ended up getting a degree in something else. Are there MS programs for total newbies like me that want to get into the field?  submitted by /u/rAlexanderAcosta [link] [comments]
