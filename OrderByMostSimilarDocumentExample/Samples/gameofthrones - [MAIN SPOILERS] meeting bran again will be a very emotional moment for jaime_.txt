[MAIN SPOILERS] meeting bran again will be a very emotional moment for jaime.
it seems like jaime isn't the same jerk he was in season 1. all the hardship he has had to face has helped him grow and change as a person. he has also had to learn about how to live with a disability after locke cut off his hand. losing a hand had a huge emotional impact on jaime, probably a lot more than he shows. facing bran will be like admitting that he is just like locke since he crippled bran in a similar way.  to add to this bran will probably say something robotic like "i killed locke at crastors keep. you don't have to worry about him anymore".  will this meeting make jaime have an emotional meltdown?  submitted by /u/LanceThunder [link] [comments]
