What the heck’s the deal with iOS and no scroll on the body?!
I’m a developer at an agency, I build a ton of ecommerce websites at work, and as a result, a lot of full-screen mobile menus. Now on desktop, I can just have JQ add a no-scroll class to the body and have it set to overflow: hidden, but on mobile, or specifically iOS, this seems damn near impossible. If the menu is scrollable, it plays havoc on the actual page content behind the menu also scrolling. Is there a definitive method to prevent this indefinitely? I just can’t find a solution anywhere. A good example of this problem is on Razer’s website.  submitted by /u/ConduciveMammal [link] [comments]
