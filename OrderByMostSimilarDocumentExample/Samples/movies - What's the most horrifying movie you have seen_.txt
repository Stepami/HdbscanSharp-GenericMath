What's the most horrifying movie you have seen?
For me it's The Descent (2005). If you haven't seen it, it's about a group of women who go rock climbing in an uncharted cavern but get lost in the dark and some truly horrible things happen. It's one of those movies that is dark through and through, but also really well done. A must see for fans of the genre. I watched it last night, and though I've seen it before, it's the type of movie you can't get out of your mind the next day. Others? edit: Thanks for the comments. Tonight I'm checking out Geralds Game by Stephen King starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood. I'll add a couple more to the list for anyone wanting suggestions: As Above So Below, It Follows, and 10 Cloverfield Lane are good suspense/horror flicks I've seen in recent times.  submitted by /u/OstensiblyOriginal [link] [comments]
