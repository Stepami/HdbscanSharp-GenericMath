Did you dress up as something League related for Halloween? Make League decorations or carve a pumpkin? Share them here!
Wanted to give you guys a place to show off your stuff. This is not a place to plug your cosplay instagram accounts, etc, just a place for fun sharing. Have a great night everyone! Happy Halloween from the /r/leagueoflegends mod team :)  submitted by /u/hey_its_griff [link] [comments]
