SQL Server Instance Inaccessible to Remote Client Connection
As part of trying to prepare for 70-462 exam, I am going through several exercises in Microsoft's Training Kit, Administering SQL Server 2012 Databases. In Chapter 1, exercise 5 on page 50 I am meant to test the connectivity of sql instances on some VMs. I have 6 VMs, all sitting on the same domain. Two of which have an isntance of SQL Server installed, SQL-A & SQL-B. In the domain controller I've created an Organisational Unit, adding the domain controller, SQL-A, and SQL-B. Linking it to a Group Policy Object which has an inbound rule on Windows Firewall for sqlservr.exe for everything in the subnet that the VMs are on, through any connection. As per exercise 2's instructions on page 22. However I have attempted to connect to SQL-B from SSMS in SQL-A but encounter the below error. A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 5)  I followed the instructions on this link about accidentally using dynamic ports. I can see when I run the below the port number is "0" which apparently suggests I'm still using dynamic ports (despite deleting the 0, restarting services and restarting the VMs SQL-A & SQL-B), but when looking in SQL's Error Log I can see it's listening on 1433 and 1434.  select * from sys.tcp_endpoints  Would anyone know how to go about troubleshooting this? Ways I can double check that I've configured everything correctly, narrow down what the problem is, and hopefully resolve it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  submitted by /u/RememberRem- [link] [comments]
