What should you know coming out of college with a computer science major?
I've been in college 2 and half years and I don't really know anything. I can program basic stuff and I'm mainly good at making websites. To be honest I don't really understand any of theories and I can't really program any data structures. What should I know? Today I just realized I don't really care or take any of my classes serious. I'm not doing the best, but I'm not failing either. I want to be more involved in what we are learning. Many of the classes I'm in are based on previous information, but I never understood it. So I would like to improve to actually be a computer scientist instead of just getting a degree and not knowing anything.  submitted by /u/birdy_007 [link] [comments]
