What kind of background material could I look at for a procedural generation project?
I'm doing a procedural generation based project for my dissertation but I'm a little lost as to what I should be researching. So far, I've been looking at two types of algorithms; Diamond Square and Perlin Noise but I'm not sure what else to be looking for. I'm going to be rendering the planet in real time and generating multiple planets with different surfaces types (rocky, smooth, etc) then analysing the performance. For my performance analysis, I'm not sure what would be best to analyse; memory used? FPS? Anyone mind giving me a few tips please?  submitted by /u/ThePoundDollar [link] [comments]
