[NO SPOILERS] Just had an idea about an ultimate outcome for Cersei to become the all powerful Queen she so badly wants to be.
What if, somehow, she meets with the Night King and convinces him to make her his Night Queen. Would he turn her? Would he let her stay "human"? I picture an intense scene with the two of them and The Mountain standing by her side. Hmm... neither of them talk, do they? I guess it wouldn't be that intense. How will Jaime react if/when they go to battle and he sees her by his side? What about the baby? Oh well, just a thought while I was stuck doing the dishes...  submitted by /u/banelover76 [link] [comments]
