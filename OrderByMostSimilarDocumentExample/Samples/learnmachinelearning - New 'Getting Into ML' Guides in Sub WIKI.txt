New 'Getting Into ML' Guides in Sub WIKI
Hey subscribers of r/learnmachinelearning, I created a set of guides that hopefully can in future provide guidance to people new to Machine Learning and looking to get more involved with it. Recognising that not everybody wants the same thing out of the Machine Learning field, I've create different guides for different 'use-cases' The High Schoolers guide if, quite obviously for people not yet out of high school but interested in ML The Engineers guide is for people that are interested in ML but don't really want to do academic research The Academics/Researchers guide is for those that want to do research, to innovate, and to push the frontier of artificial intelligence The Hackers Guide is for the most casual ML enthusiastic; someone who just wants to build cool projects on the weekend or at hackathons or on lab day  I'd love to get feedback on them. You can find them on the newly cleaned up Wiki index page for the sub. Put your thoughts and feedback in this thread, or just message me directly. I don't think you can comment on the wiki articles themselves unfortunately.  submitted by /u/thundergolfer [link] [comments]
