Why is Mercy the only support with the "I am under attack" voice line?
While it's perhaps true that Mercy perhaps is the most vulnerable to people attacking her than compared to supports, I feel that if there was some way for the other supports to say that they're taking damage verbally it would be at great benefit to the team. If you hear Mercy saying "Help me" you'll probably try to see who's attacking her and help out, I think Ana and Zenyatta would benefit greatly from this and would help to increase their survivability.  submitted by /u/QuemesTC [link] [comments]
