udemy's machine learning course
https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/ im thinking about dropping 15 euros for it im also the kind of guy who reads the lowest rating... and a lot of them say that it's just a tutorial on tensorflow, but the instructor doesnt actually explain how it works any feedback from these courses?  submitted by /u/handspinnerdu59 [link] [comments]
