A website to jumpstart your research? How to approach new topic?
I am currently looking at what the state of the art is in live speech-to-text transcription and am once again baffled how scattered the information is. At university, this is totally fine since I can put in the time to read a bunch of papers and look at different benchmarks, but this time I only want to put together a demo project - which means I want to optimize the time I put in. I am curious: Is there a website that aggregates the state of the art for different machine learning topics? If not: how do you approach learning a new topic? read the most cited papers on google scholar? just google and look for smart looking medium articles?  submitted by /u/derdav3 [link] [comments]
