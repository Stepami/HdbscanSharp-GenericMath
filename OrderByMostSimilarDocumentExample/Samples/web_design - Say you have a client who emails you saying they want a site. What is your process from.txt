Say you have a client who emails you saying they want a site. What is your process from beginning to end?
Fellow web designer here. I've had around 10 projects which mostly have gone well. Sometimes though, I feel like I need more of a well-defined process to follow throughout the project. What do you use for a process, and what documents do you give clients. I guess I'm asking for a walk through of a usual web design case. So it might be something like: Initial contact -> Questionairre -> Wireframe -> Contract -> First payment -> Building of site -> Final payment -> Launch All replies appreciated!
