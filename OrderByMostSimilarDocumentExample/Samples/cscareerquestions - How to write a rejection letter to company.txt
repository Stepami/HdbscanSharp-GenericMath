How to write a rejection letter to company
First time ever doing this. I feel bad because they did up their offer a bit, but I got a different offer I liked better (in reference to the work, not the salary). How does the following sound, too formal? Hi PERSON, I want to thank you and everyone at COMPANY for extending me the offer. However I'll have to decline as I have accepted an offer elsewhere. I hope you have luck finding someone suitable for the position.   submitted by /u/BonafideVagabond [link] [comments]
