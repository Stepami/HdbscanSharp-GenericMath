Weird behavior at job
This is a throw away account (can't use my account). I work as a DevOps engineer at a small/medium sized firm. Was hired almost 2 years ago and work in a team of only 2 (me and my manager). I have been solely responsible for moving/migrating their infrastructure over to AWS. The project that I am working on is going great, internal users as well as external clients that we support have given extremely good reviews and the clients we were losing over the existing infrastructure on premise have started coming back i.e generating revenue for the company. Now since I am solely responsible for the entire project, I was always called into meetings to discuss the plan and see how things are going, next steps etc. Over the past couple of weeks, all of a sudden I have been excluded from all meetings, any discussion that happens include my manager and I get to know things from him (if he tells me). Before I was always called into any meeting no matter if it was just a 15 min discussion. There have been 3 new projects that have been assigned to our team of 2 and I know nothing about them, I kind of feel this is something strange and am worried. Also is it common to never receive credit for hard work (I work late nights, mostly 10-12 hours a day). As soon as I tell my manager about any new thing that i implemented or a bug that I ironed out - he sends an email to management stating "I" (he) did that. I did not know about this until some one replied to his email and cc'ed me on the email thread. All of this has started to make me depressed and I am stressing out, Is this a red flag should I start looking for new jobs? Please help :(  submitted by /u/redditor6454 [link] [comments]
