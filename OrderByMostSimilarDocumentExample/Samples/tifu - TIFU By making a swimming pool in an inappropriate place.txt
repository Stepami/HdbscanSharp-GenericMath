TIFU By making a swimming pool in an inappropriate place
This happened about 10 minutes ago, and Im actually dying on the inside. I'm a 19 year old IT apprentice out on a trip setting up some equipment for a company, and the equipment installation is a 2 day thing. My company booked a nice hotel, and everything was going just dandy. Until I fancied a nice bath. Here I hit the first snag, which was that the plug didn't work. No bother I'll put a cup over the hole instead, and thatll keep the bath water in. Quite pleased with my self I go and make my self some hot chocolate, pop on my noise cancelling earphones and have a phone call with my mate. For 30 minutes. After this time had passed in blissful chatting, my brain suddenly thought it would be super helpful for me to check my bath. When this happened I knew something bad would have happened, but as the lights were off, I had yet to comprehend the scale of the damage. I put my socked foot off of the bed, and to my utter dismay it was immediately drenched in warm water. At this point my heart sank. I hit the light switch and what I saw would give water-world a run for its money. The entire room was absolutely soaked. My bag that I'd left on the floor, was dripping and the carpet was ruined. I immediately dash to reception and the immediate diagnosis was, that damages would be charged, and that I'd have to move to a different room. Turns out the only spare room was a disabled one, which my boss was quick to mention that it seemed fitting. So now I'm sat in my disabled room, with a bag of damp clothes, a mind full of damp emotions, and my brain running all of the possible scenarios over in my head, and honestly not knowing what to do. TL;DR I made a swimming pool out of my company paid for hotel room, and I'm feeling a little damp about it all.  submitted by /u/GreenLarry [link] [comments]
