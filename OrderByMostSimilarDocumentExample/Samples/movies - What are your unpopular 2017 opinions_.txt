What are your unpopular 2017 opinions?
I know the year isn´t over but we have had a substantial amount of movies released as of today and I think we can have a good discussion. For me it boils down to two movies. First I think Ghost in the Shell wasn´t as bad as some people said it was. I actually think it is a visually impressive film and whitewashing controversy aside I think the plot and acting were decent. The second movie I wanna talk about is Dunkirk. I went to see it on IMAX and I wasn´t as impressed as others. I think its a good movie but for me it isn´t Nolans best nor it comes close to that. I still think the movie would have benefit from an R rating but maybe that is just me. The bloodless war scenes kinda took me out of the movie but maybe thats just me since I like my war movies violent. And before someone else says anything I know Nolan doesn´t consider Dunkirk a war movie but more of an escape/survival movie. I know this but it is just my opinion.  submitted by /u/Johnny_Monsanto [link] [comments]
