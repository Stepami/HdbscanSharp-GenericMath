Probability of classes in an UNsupervised setting? (Interview question)
Hello, I had a very puzzling question in a job interview that made my choke. I was asked to outline a model that would give the probability Here's the basic setup: You have data on all credit card transactions for a full calendar year for a certain CC operator. Data includes: cc identifier, transaction time, amount, description. The question: give the probability a given CC was created before that calendar year started (or alternatively, the 1 - probability CC was created during the year). My approach was to basically use a recency-frequency perspective (i.e. if a CC is used daily since seeing the first transaction forward, but the first transaction recorded is in June, it's probably a new CC, whereas a CC used once a month and we have a transaction in February, it's not unlikely the CC was created in previous year(s). There are other things you can use too (like trying to work with the description text, see if the total amount spent a month ramps up from 0 to something much higher, etc.), but what got me stumped me was the ask to give a model than can return a probability, as I don't have the true labels. Any ideas? Insights? Thanks!  submitted by /u/Optimesh [link] [comments]
