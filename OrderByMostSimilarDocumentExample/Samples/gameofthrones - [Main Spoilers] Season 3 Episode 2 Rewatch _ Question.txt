[Main Spoilers] Season 3 Episode 2 Rewatch / Question
So I am currently watching “Dark Wings, Dark Words and I just hit the point where Arya, Hotpie, and Gendry are encountered by The Brotherhood Without Banners. What I still don’t fully understand is how the archer and Thoros of Myr know who is hiding. Arya steps out from behind the ruins and is speaking to them. Thoros asks, “how come your friends are so shy?” He could have assumed she was with people because when she was referring to herself she said “we” as if there were others. But how did The BWOB give a brief description of Hotpie. Is this a special talent or skill of some sort in the word of GoT, or is it just something added in the script to add humor or mystery?  submitted by /u/ImSkoupidia [link] [comments]
