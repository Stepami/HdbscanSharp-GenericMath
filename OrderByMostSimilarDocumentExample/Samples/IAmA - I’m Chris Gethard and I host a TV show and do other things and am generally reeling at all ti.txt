I’m Chris Gethard and I host a TV show and do other things and am generally reeling at all times – AMA
I’m Chris Gethard and I’m a comedian, actor, writer and the creator and host of the live variety talk show, The Chris Gethard Show, airing every Thursday on truTV. You can watch clips from the show here. I also host the podcast Beautiful/Anonymous, where random anonymous phone callers share their stories with me. Lastly, I was in a recent HBO special called Career Suicide. The album comes out at the end of this week! Proof: https://i.redd.it/pf3gcqffreuz.jpg  submitted by /u/chrisgethard [link] [comments]
