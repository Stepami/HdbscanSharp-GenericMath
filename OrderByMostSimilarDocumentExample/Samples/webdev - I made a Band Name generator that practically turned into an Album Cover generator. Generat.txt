I made a Band Name generator that practically turned into an Album Cover generator. Generate one of 99,025,000 possible names.
I made this initially as just a band name generator but I made it generate a random cover too, inspired by the r/FakeAlbumCover subreddit. I categorized 2,590 handpicked words, 220 fonts and 418 images into the 3 seperate genres, to assure that you always get an appopriate name, song, font and cover image for the "genre" the album gets. All in all it took a week to make this. http://rocklou.com/bandnamegenerator  submitted by /u/rocklou [link] [comments]
