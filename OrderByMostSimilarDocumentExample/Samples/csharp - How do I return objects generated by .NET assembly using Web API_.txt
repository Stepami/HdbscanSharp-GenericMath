How do I return objects generated by .NET assembly using Web API?
Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems relatively simple to create a basic API using .NET when you are able to define or import the data model. However, in my particular case, the output is being generated by a .NET assembly, and instances of its defined classes. Now, trying to push this information in JSON format using Web API seems much less trivial. I've scoured Google, and perhaps I'm not using the proper search terms, because nothing is coming back very helpful. I was hoping that someone here might be able to provide some guidance.
