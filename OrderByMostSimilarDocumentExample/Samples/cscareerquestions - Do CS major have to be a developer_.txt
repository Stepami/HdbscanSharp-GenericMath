Do CS major have to be a developer?
Hey, please forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask my question. Background story: I’m a senior at a local university. I find my university to be very easy and isn’t challenging. I always have all As, and the coding assignments are not that hard (very basic/ I can get A just by having the correct thought process). I then thought that CS is for me, and I really thought that I like to code for daily job until I transfer to a top 10 university for CS. During my journey on the new campus, I find that I really don’t like coding. I’m dreading to code full working projects (bigger scope than previous univ’s assignments). It’s annoying, and I don’t want to do it anymore. Though, I have 5 semesters internship experiences, where I’m working on data analytics using analytical tools (this is probably the only thing that’s going to save me, but idk for sure). What are my options after graduation? Should I change major?  submitted by /u/OngoingReady [link] [comments]
