Thanks /r/music. Discovered something about myself.
I'm slowly working through the Reddit Beautiful songs playlist while working. I'm listening to something fantastic and quickly plop it into my instrumental category (typically reserved for classical pieces and sometimes instrumental versions of favorite songs). After about 7 minutes of the same song (that I'm still really, really enjoying, I was quite surprised to see that it was Metallica's To Live is To Die. I've always assumed that I disliked heavy metal and Metallica just is "not for me." But...wow, if this is even remotely representative of what exists in the heavy metal genre, I've been missing out and have some serious catching up to do. Thanks all! I'm listening to it a second time. It's so good!  submitted by /u/untildeath [link] [comments]
