What are your UX suggestions for combining a Wordpress site with a Shopify store?
We have a client with an established site on Wordpress who is coming to us to create an e-commerce store. We specialize in Shopify (client knows and accepts this), so I'm trying to think through the best user experience for a user going from their main website to their store. As expected, the client would like for the store to look exactly like their site so it seems like it IS the same place when a user clicks the 'store' link in the nav. Though it's possible to style the store this way, this will obviously cause problems for the user because some things won't be consistent (e.g. there will be cart on the store but not the website, plus other slight difference between the two platforms that the user will intuitively notice while navigating). To avoid this confusion, my first thought is to make the store look different than the main site, with clear navigation back to the main site so the user knows they are in a different location and how to get back if they need to. The store will be hosted at store.client.com. Just curious if anyone has dealt with this situation. At the moment a whole site migration to Shopify isn't being discussed and wouldn't be wise as their current site has a long history and probably a good amount of SEO value.  submitted by /u/orestmercator [link] [comments]
