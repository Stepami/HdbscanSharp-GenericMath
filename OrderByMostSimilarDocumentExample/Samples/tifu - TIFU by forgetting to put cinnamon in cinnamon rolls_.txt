TIFU by forgetting to put cinnamon in cinnamon rolls...
It's a pretty PG story and mildly boring, nothing cool like putting my cooch in a coconut (is that even possible?), but it happened and I'm ashamed. I'm a pretty skilled baker and cook and when I'm stressed or feeling really any strong emotion, I bake. Today I had some leftover crescent roll dough and just wanted to make some easy little cinnamon rolls. As I rolled the brown sugar mixture onto the unbaked dough, I wondered why it was so lightly colored. I kept feeling as though I was forgetting something. 7 minutes into baking, I realized I forgot the cinnamon in the mixture. I'm a novice and now have some weak ass cinnamon rolls. *I tried to counter my mistake by sprinkling cinnamon on top. It was sub par as you'd imagine. TL;DR: I forgot the cinnamon in the cinnamon rolls and don't deserve to claim that I can bake.  submitted by /u/lizonurface [link] [comments]
