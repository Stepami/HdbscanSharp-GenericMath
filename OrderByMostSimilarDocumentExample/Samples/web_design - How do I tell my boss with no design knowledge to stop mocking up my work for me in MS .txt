How do I tell my boss with no design knowledge to stop mocking up my work for me in MS Paint?
I'm a web designer for a small niche marketing company and the only person I work with is the President of the company. He has no design background whatsoever, but that doesn't stop him from taking the preliminary designs I do, screenshotting work that I'm currently coding, and coming up with his own design for work I haven't even been given yet all in MS Paint. It's not downright terrible but most of it he just copies concepts almost verbatim from other websites, mixing in lots of annoying things like completely inconsistent font sizes and weights etc. This is killing my own creative process because instead of being able to think through how I feel a page should be laid out and then create that in a way that looks nice and suits it's purpose, I have to start and stick closely to a page layout that this guy made which is going to have lots of issues that need to be sorted out.  submitted by /u/shootflexo [link] [comments]
