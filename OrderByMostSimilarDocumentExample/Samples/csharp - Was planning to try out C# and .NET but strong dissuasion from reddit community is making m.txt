Was planning to try out C# and .NET but strong dissuasion from reddit community is making me think otherwise, need clarified response to help me decide
For background, I have been working with Java, Python and a bit of Jscript/HTML/CSS for a past couple years. I have heard a lot about C# and how Microsoft is expanding their contributions to open source community and their embracing of linux system (recent windows update implied this). However, I was told my many people and many users on reddit that C# isn't that great of a language (compared to Java or other OOP) and it is strictly restricted within Microsoft's Windows ecosystem. They said that .NET Core is still barebone so it will take ages before getting anything done with C#/.NET on a non-Microsoft environment. I would be glad if someone clarifies the facts I mentioned and whether they are authentic. I am interested in learning C# but I it won't be viable for me to make Windows exclusive programs and webapps, especially with the outrageous Azure pricing.  submitted by /u/RordonGamsy [link] [comments]
