[AMA Request] The North Korean defectors from Asian Boss
My 5 Questions: Are most North Koreans looking to escape? Is the state media persuasive? Is Pyongyang representative of other cities in DPRK? Are average North Koreans aware the government is diverting money from agriculture and food and towards military and the nuclear program? What did you expect South Korea to be like before you escaped, and how well does it meet that expectation?
