How can I get my designer to implement my designs as I want them to be?
I am the CEO of a small company and because it is a small company I have to get my hands dirty with pretty much every aspect. I work directly with everybody and I get great results from everyone. Well... everyone except my designer. I don't think his designs are in tune with what I want for my company. I do have a background in graphic design and I would love to just do the designs myself but I never have the time. I don't want to fire my designer as I think he is a great guy and he is constantly improving but he is young and he has trouble grasping the idea of brand identity. I've had to mock-up some of his designs in f**cking MS Paint (we are a start-up. can't afford real software for everyone!) but I am finding it very hard to get the concepts across to him... Anyone have any tips on how to approach this?  submitted by /u/Yumyuckyumyuck [link] [comments]
