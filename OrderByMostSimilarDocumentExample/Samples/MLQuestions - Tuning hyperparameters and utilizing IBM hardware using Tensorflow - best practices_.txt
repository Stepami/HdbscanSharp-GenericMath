Tuning hyperparameters and utilizing IBM hardware using Tensorflow - best practices?
I am training a CNN on my laptop and have access to IBM Data Science Experience and Bluemix. What is the best way to implement the training setup on remote hardware? Jupyter notebooks are kinda clunky. I thought it may be useful to put everything in a docker image, but are there cleaner options? Ideally I would run the script on my laptop, but tensorflow would upload the data to their servers for running hyperparameter optimization code (I don't want to train dozens of CNNs on my GPU). Those familiar with Tensorflow and IBM Bluemix/DSX, what do you think?  submitted by /u/zcleghern [link] [comments]
