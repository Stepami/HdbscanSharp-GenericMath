TIFU by pressing a panic button thinking it was a door release
Like most post this was not today. This was years ago, I was at a posh mates place. It is a big place in some woodlands in the middle of nowhere. We had just finished a house party in the aupair's wing (yes really that big and posh of a place, they where between aupair's at the time) and the host who was the son of the owner was wrecked and the rest of us was trying to leave. The front door was hard to open we tried everything we could think of, there was no key hole, there was just a handle that would not turn. What there was, on the door frame was a little box with a button we pushed it thinking it was a door realise button. We had to sober the host up a little which took about 5 minutes and he explained where the key hole was hidden like a Chinese box puzzle and where the key was, we had finally escaped. Five minutes down the road back on the main road, a couple police car goes storming by at a rate of knots and we think nothing of it. The next day we all wake and find a mass of missed calls from the host and a few irate messages. Turns out when we left he had gone to sleep/passed out on the sofa in the aupair's place. The police had responded to the silent panic button, they turned up to discover no answer from the house at the security gate. They ended up calling reinforcements fearing a hostage situation and stormed the house breaking the front gate and smashing the front door in. Only to find my mate asleep on a sofa and loads of empty alcohol bottles. Let's just say his dad had to pay a lot of money out, he was not allowed anyone over to his house ever again, he was grounded for ages and sent to rehab for alcoholics after being given multiple telling's off from the police and his parents. I saw him once half a year later but too much damage had been down to the friendship. TL;DR PUSHED A PANIC BUTTON AND GOT MY MATE IN TO serious TROUBLE  submitted by /u/jaceinthebox [link] [comments]
