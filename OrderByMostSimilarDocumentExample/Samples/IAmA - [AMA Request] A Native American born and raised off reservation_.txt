[AMA Request] A Native American born and raised off reservation.
Questions 1 - how does it feel like to have your peoples culture put on sports teams.? QUESTIONS 2 - Do you feel like you have lived a different life than your people because you lived in the city? QUESTIONS 3 - How do you feel about the way your people have been portraited in film and television? QUESTIONS 4 - What do you think about native American music and arts? QUESTIONS 5 - Do you know your peoples language? The reason I am asking this ama is because I know someone who is Native American born and raised off reservation and people bring this up a lot with him. And on here this is so people like to talk about and have wanted to know more about. So please let me know if you want to know more about this. I can and will get back to about the person I know.  submitted by /u/Running4coffee [link] [comments]
