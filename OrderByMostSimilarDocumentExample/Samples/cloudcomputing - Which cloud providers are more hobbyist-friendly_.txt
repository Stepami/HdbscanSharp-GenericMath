Which cloud providers are more hobbyist-friendly?
I've always wanted to experiment with personal projects on "the cloud" but I'm not sure which providers are more inclined to accomodate hobbyists like myself, and which ones aren't really willing to give the time of day to hobbyists/casual users/learners (preferring to cater to enterprise customers instead). My preference would be a provider that is willing to accommodate small-scale hobbyists, without sacrificing flexibility/features/performance too much (e.g. managed databases would be pretty sweet). I heard about this company called "Paperspace" that offers desktop computer instances in the cloud, but I'm not sure that really counts. I was hoping to get some better answers in this subreddit. Thank you.  submitted by /u/tocho_kouhou [link] [comments]
