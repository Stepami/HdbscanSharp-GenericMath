Centering text in a div?
Ok disclaimer, I'm teaching myself to code to build a portfolio site and I'm a super amateur. Not sure if I'm in the right sub for this, but I am having a problem getting text to be vertically centered in a colored div. This could all be super wrong but here is a section of my code for example HMTL:     NAME      CSS: body { background-color:grey; margin: 0; padding: 0; } header {  position: static; position: top:0px; background-color: black; height: 35vw; width: 100%; margin:auto; padding:auto; display: inline-block;}  h1 { text-align: center; color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10vw; } Any help would me much appreciated or if someone could point me to the right place  submitted by /u/Hjude [link] [comments]
