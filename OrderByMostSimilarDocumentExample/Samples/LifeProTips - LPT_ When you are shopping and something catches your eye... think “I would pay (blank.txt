LPT: When you are shopping and something catches your eye... think “I would pay (blank) for this!” Then check the tag. This will make you think about the worth of things and curb impulse buys.
Works mostly when shopping in stores when the price isn’t shown immediately.  submitted by /u/livdavo [link] [comments]
