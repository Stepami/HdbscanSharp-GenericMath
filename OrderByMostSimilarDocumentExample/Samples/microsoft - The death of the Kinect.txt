The death of the Kinect
I am appalled by the decision to kill off the Kinect. The Kinect went beyond gaming and became about interacting with the environment. Interactive shop displays, 3D modelling, gesture detection for industrial environments. I am sure that there was good financial reason for it. But it should have been sold off to let someone else explore its potential and continue the development. Fine, I'll move over to the Realsense camera, I am getting good at doing that. Start with something MS and switch over when they dump it. As a developer having been burnt on Foxpro, MS phone and now the Kinect. I guess I am slow to learn that starting with a MS product is a risky bet.  submitted by /u/iChinguChing [link] [comments]
