How secure/safe are the details used to register and log into a small website?
A local club I belong to, which has around 100 members, has a website with a members area where we are meant to pick up bit of information that 'they' don't want the general public to know because it contains names, addresses, and telephone numbers. This members area used to have a regularly changed, generic, password that everybody used. It worked just fine; it was easy. The new person running the website has changed the way this members area works so that everybody has to have their own 'private' login. Under their new rules we have each got to register, using exactly the same personal details as on our membership application - including the same email address - otherwise they won't physically 'approve' the registration and we won't be able to access to this members area. I can't use a new throwaway email account without changing all my membership details, and would have to regularly check that account for emails from the secretary etc.. How can I be sure that my personal details will be 'safe'? Am in UK, if it's relevant. If this isn't the right sub for this question, could you point me in the right direction please. Thanks.  submitted by /u/6beesknees [link] [comments]
