Learning ML by working together
Hey, I am fairly new to Machine Learning and find it hard to dive into all these different ML algorithms and Neural Network structures and I can imagine that some of you feel the same.. So I thought we could start a learning group to gain more knowledge with less time researching different topics. If everyone in this group researches a topic and prepares a presentation, one doesn't only teaches the others, but also reinforces the stuff he has learned, by teaching the others. (a win-win situation!!). If anyone is interested, join the discord server: https://discord.gg/urhfGk4  submitted by /u/themaehn [link] [comments]
