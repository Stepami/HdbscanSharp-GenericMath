[SSIS] Trying to use SSIS to grab data from a Timberline DB, working, but SSIS won't store connection string password.
Running SQL Server 2014, using SSIS to pull data from a Timberline DB into a staging table to reference. If I enter the password for the connection string into the command line PWD=, it works once, but won't save the password. I've done some searching found that SQL Server hard-sets this as sensitive data, which is fine, but I can't figure out how to work around that. A lot of the tips I'm finding online have info that relates to older versions of SQL and doesn't seem relevant anymore. Any tips?  submitted by /u/IForgotMyPasswordGrr [link] [comments]
