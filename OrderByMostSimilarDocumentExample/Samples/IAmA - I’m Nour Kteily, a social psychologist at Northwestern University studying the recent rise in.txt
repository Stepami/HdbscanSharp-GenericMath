I’m Nour Kteily, a social psychologist at Northwestern University studying the recent rise in dehumanization, and thinking about effective ways to counteract it. AMA!
Welcome to my Reddit AMA, and thanks for your interest! My name is Nour Kteily. I'm currently a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management, where I teach negotiation and conflict resolution. I’m trained as a social psychologist, and my research focuses on the psychology of social hierarchy and inequality. Recently, my colleagues (especially the awesome Emile Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania) and I have been doing a lot of work to understand the role that dehumanization plays in provoking cycles of conflict around the world, and thinking about ways to counteract its consequences. Here’s a link to a podcast I was on last year discussing tribalism, and some of my public writing about my work here and here. Ask me anything!

I promise to do my best to come back and answer the questions I couldn't get to, so keep them coming. It's been wonderful reading all of your very thoughtful questions! Some might even say I found it a humanity-affirming exercise :-)  submitted by /u/nour_kteily [link] [comments]
