Approach to clustering similar images ?
heres what I have and waht I have in mind: I have a set of images, which many of them have a certain pattern and similar placements of objects in them. I want to cluster them into a minimal amount of bins or a algorithmically determined amount of bins (think knn) I have tried searching for things like "clustering similar images" but I dont get any good results for that because I get mostly results for image segmentation which I do not want accuracy is not important for me, as this is for visualization purposes only, and as long as they look similar they can stay in the same bin. is there an algorithm or a model that does what I have in mind ? You might think: Another idea would be to analyze the images without any ml, but since the images have distinc patterns and non consistent colors across similar images in them I dont know how I could do this without ml disclaimer: I am new to this please dont be all "this would take budget of a billion dollars and a whole reasearch team"  submitted by /u/ZettTheArcWarden [link] [comments]
