Convert YYMMDD to YYYYMMDD not working for year 1949
Hello Any idea how to get around this issue? anything above 50 converts to the 1900's which is correct. Anything below 50 goes to the 2000's. Yes I can write a little hack but there will be valid cases where let's say for example 17 is equal to the year 2017 and not the year 1917 select REPLACE(try_CAST(LEFT(49020488771,6) AS DATE),'-',''); --20490204 select REPLACE(try_CAST(LEFT(50020488771,6) AS DATE),'-',''); --19500204 select REPLACE(try_CAST(LEFT(83062188771,6) AS DATE),'-',''); --19830621  submitted by /u/rwoeke [link] [comments]
