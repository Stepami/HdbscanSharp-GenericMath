is ASP.NET Core 2 RAZOR pages ready for production ?
Hi, I am experienced web dev with Graiils (Groovy On Rails) and PHP (YII & Laravel). But my boss want me to use .NET Framework for the next project. I have no background with ASP.NET before. But I hear that Microsoft just release ASP.NET Core 2.0 Razor Pages which is MVVM style. But there are lack resources in the internet and I have not found any book that can be my resource (most of the book about ASP.NET CORE MVC). So now I want to know whether the ASP.NET CORE 2.0 Razor pages ready for production ? my next project will need a lot of Forms and Reporting ... especially to export and importing data from EXCEL and producing PDF Report. Should I use Razor one or MVC one ? Thanks  submitted by /u/nightingale2k1 [link] [comments]
