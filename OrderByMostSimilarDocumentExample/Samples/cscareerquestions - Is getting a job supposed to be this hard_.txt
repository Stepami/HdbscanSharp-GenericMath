Is getting a job supposed to be this hard?
I'm graduating this December but my first CS-related internship was this past summer because I switched late. I do have a strong CS background growing up. I've been applying to jobs since late August with no success. 200 job applications actually. I've only gotten responses from 20 of them, a lot of them from referrals. That turned into 5 on-site interviews, 3 of which have been rejections and the other 2 upcoming ones I've lost all confidence for. I've become a social recluse turning down all social activities to apply to jobs/practice technical questions/interview. Or struggling to finish my schoolwork because of lack of time. I'm definitely not suicidal or anything like that other guy, but so I'm just so fucking stressed out and frustrated right now. Like I know I'm smart (like actually smart: I placed in all sorts of math competitions growing up, among other things) and I figure that as long as I've been working hard like I have been, I should've gotten something by now, but I haven't. And it's already November, and before you know it the holiday season is upon us and it's 2018. (Remember, I graduate this December). Is my experience uncommon? I also go to a top 20 U.S. college, but NOT one for CS. In some fields you're guaranteed to know my college, but software engineers I've met have asked if it was a community college.  submitted by /u/JobEmploymentCareer [link] [comments]
