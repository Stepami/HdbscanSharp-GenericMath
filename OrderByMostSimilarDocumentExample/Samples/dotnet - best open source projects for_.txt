best open source projects for...
I'm looking to evaluate the test impact analysis on VSTS. more about that here: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/03/02/accelerated-continuous-testing-with-test-impact-analysis-part-1/ My idea is to test out a bunch of open source projects that already have test methods written for them, and run it against VSTS's TIA feature to see how well the TIA feature performs. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with TIA or the open source world to know which projects are good and which are bad. I've already tried dotnet-state-machine/stateless Newtonsoft.Json AutoMapper/AutoMapper  from Github, but they break the TIA feature since all three are either built on .net core or have a component that is .net core. and .net core is not supported in TIA. Details of what's supported and what's not is in the link above, would someone knowledgeable kindly review the supported/not supported section in the link and point me in the right direction? Any help would be appreciated! -.net n00b  submitted by /u/fattymcbaddy [link] [comments]
