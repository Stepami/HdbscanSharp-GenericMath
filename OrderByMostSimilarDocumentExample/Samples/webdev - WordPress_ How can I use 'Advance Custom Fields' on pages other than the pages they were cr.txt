WordPress: How can I use 'Advance Custom Fields' on pages other than the pages they were created for? More details inside.
I used the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to create a dynamic contact page for a client and thought about using some of the information from the contact page in the footer. I would think the fields can be created as variables in the header.php then used in the footer.php so the address and such that I want to include in the footer is consistent with the address on the contact page. On the contact page, I defined the ACF as variables, then echo those variables in their appropriate places, like so (crude example):    Then in the HTML part of things on the contact page template:  <?php echo $phone_number;?></a> </code></pre> <p>However, if I try using the <em>get_field();</em> function for the phone number on the header and echo it in the footer it does not pull in that info. I've noticed that each custom field has a unique field key as well and would guess that this is how I can get the contact page's custom fields to display on the footer regardless which page I am on. I have tried to search for this and read through their docs as well but cannot make sense of it as my PHP knowledge is not so good and I am not too experienced with the plugin beyond basic things.</p> <p>Is there someone that could ELI5 how I can accomplish this or provide some examples? In the meantime, I'll try to keep reading up on this and trying to figure things out. Thanks in advance.</p> <p>I'm looking into <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/get-values-from-an-options-page/">their docs on getting variables from an options page</a> as well as using the <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/acf_add_options_page/">acf_add_options_page();</a> command to make things global at this time and think this could be what I was looking for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tichdyjr"> /u/tichdyjr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7a4b7l/wordpress_how_can_i_use_advance_custom_fields_on/">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7a4b7l/wordpress_how_can_i_use_advance_custom_fields_on/">[comments]</a></span>
