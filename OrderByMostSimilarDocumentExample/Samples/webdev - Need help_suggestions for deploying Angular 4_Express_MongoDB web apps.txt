Need help/suggestions for deploying Angular 4/Express/MongoDB web apps
Hi everyone! I'm the head of a student-run web app dev org at my university. We have a few apps (3) in the pipeline using Angular 4 for the frontend and ExpressJS + MongoDB for the backend. I was wondering what the best deployment might be for these. These applications will be used solely by the population on campus, so maximum ~3000 users cumulative over all the applications. Our organization already has a DigitalOcean droplet, but it's low-memory (512MB) and only 1 CPU. 20GB of storage, but I that's plenty for our use, I think. I have no clue if what we have will be enough. Do you guys have any input? Here are some possible options: Option 1: host frontend, backend, and mongod instance on droplet. the droplet doesn't have any high-load applications on it right now - the only one on it handles maybe 100 requests per day. Option 2: host frontend and backend on droplet, mongod instance on Atlas/MLab/AppEngine/AWS (preferences here?) Option 3: move entirely to another host (and either host the database on that server or on one of the above listed). We have one app on Google App Engine, so that's a possibility. Hopefully this is enough info. I'm pretty new to deployment so I could be wrong about some stuff.  submitted by /u/fireatx [link] [comments]
