TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.
Our friends fighting for net neutrality contacted us to ask if we would once more make a stickied post about this topic. Since net neutrality is important for everyone who wants to keep enjoying a free internet - a group to which most redditors belong - the mod team has decided to allow it: Hey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now. We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join Thanks.  submitted by /u/Merari01 [link] [comments]
