Tips for setting up new database environment
Hello! I have shifted from a general sysadmin to handling a lot more of our SQL systems. We just got budget approval for all new hardware and Microsoft SQL 2016 Enterprise. This will include all new servers,flash storage, and clustering. I have been doing a lot of research and am well aware of the basics like setting up auditing,alerting,backups,testing restores, setting max memory and a lot of the other tips i have read. I am curious if anyone who has been working on SQL for a while has tips or tricks I should know when starting from the ground up that i may regret not doing later. We are a health care facility and our databases mainly host applications used by staff, very little internal development is done. Thanks for any help!  submitted by /u/Pirated_Freeware [link] [comments]
