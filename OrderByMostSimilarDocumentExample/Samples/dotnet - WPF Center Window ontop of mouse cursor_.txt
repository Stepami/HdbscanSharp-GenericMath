WPF Center Window ontop of mouse cursor.
Hello all. I am having a hell of a time trying to find a solution to this problem. Essentially all I need to do is center my WPF Window on top of the mouse cursor. This has been anything but easy, and I'm not entirely sure why. this would be a cakewalk in Win Forms... someone please help! haha..   Here is my code: (Sorry, I can't get the code to display correctly in here, so I posted it on an external note website.) https://justpaste.it/1cyz2   Ok, so I have the interop includes, the required structs for the interop code, a function which simply returns a Point class instantiated with the cords pulled in from the interop function, and lastly threadTimer that simply calls the function that updates the window location (sets top/left of the window) to the X/Y coords. However, this does not work.. It works, but the it has some serious issues.   Issue #1: I have a timer with the code that sets the window position to the mouse location. When moving the mouse, the location of the form in relation to the cursor actually CHANGES depending on where the cursor is. It seems the closer it is to the top left of my primary monitor, the closer the window is to centering ontop of the cursor. The further you get from the top left, the further the form moves away from the cursor. On my secondary monitor, this is REVERED. At the top Right, the window is on top of the cursor, but the further left you move, the further the window moves from the cursor. I can't even begin to explain this behavior. So another note, as you move the cursor towards the left side of the primary(right) display, the form aligns to be directly under the cursor, but as you move to the right the window moves out, and away to the right diagonally from the cusor. The exact opposite occurs on the secondary monitor(left).   Sight, I think I am losing my mind! Please help! Lol.  submitted by /u/Jscix1 [link] [comments]
