So I went as Soldier 76 for Halloween this year, and my daughter as Mercy
Standard dad for halloween https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNficzkUIAAYZs5.jpg Lemme tell ya, trying to get a toddler to sit still, wear a hat, hold a broom is just way too much to ask for. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNg0JNXUEAAtQpk.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNgm_1tUEAAYANw.jpg Here's an earlier version of her costume before I got rid of the spiderwebbing on her hat, added a buckle, and removed the orange sash across her chest. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNQCbIyUQAAzldU.jpg Overall I'm pretty happy with how it all turned out! Hope you all had a safe halloween.  submitted by /u/Padraig-S [link] [comments]
