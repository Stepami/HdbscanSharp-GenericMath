Canny Edge Detector Image - Hysteresis thresholding
Hello, I have implemented a matlab implementation of Canny, and it seems to be working fine, but I am having issue understanding the last part which is Hysteresis thresholding. According to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRFM5IEqR2w So I have included all the pixels that are above a max_threshold (we consider edges). Now I just loop through those and check the pixels in the image from the previous stage, if nearby pixels are above the min_threshold. The I just set them to 1. Is that correct?  submitted by /u/iwanttodiequick [link] [comments]
