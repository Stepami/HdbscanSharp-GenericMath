How do I share an innerHTML element to Facebook? (Newb Question)
Hi all, I'm creating a Random Quote Generator. I would like for the quote it creates to be shared to Facebook upon a button press. For example I did this with Twitter using:  $(".twitterButtonB").click(function shareTweet() { var twitterQuote = document.getElementById("quoteTextContainer").innerHTML + document.getElementById("quoteAuthor").innerHTML; $(this).attr("href", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="+ twitterQuote); });  I've had a look at the Facebook API documents but i'm completely lost. I'm quite new to Web Development so any help is incredibly appreciated. Thank you.  submitted by /u/Guinner11 [link] [comments]
