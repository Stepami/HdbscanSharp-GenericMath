Could someone familiar with Computer Vision in academia give me some advice on applying gradschool?
Link to my cv Although having a good GPA (according to the conversion standard, my GPA is equivalent to 4.0 in US), I lack publication and research experience in Lab. _ Will I able to get into top 30 pogramme(Phd) in Canada/US? If not, what about research master that provides funding. Should I put more things into my CV? How to convey in the SOP that despite my scant experience in academic research, I would be a good candidate?  submitted by /u/RavlaAlvar [link] [comments]
