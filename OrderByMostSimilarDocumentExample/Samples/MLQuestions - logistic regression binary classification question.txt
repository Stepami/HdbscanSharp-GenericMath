logistic regression binary classification question
Having trouble figuring out how the values for w in the following situation are determined. Don't need to watch this video to answer my question, but I'm going to use the example I got from it. the video incase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2a_mzl9LM&t=710s the question: Probability of someone dying in 10 years where our input, x, consists of x1 = age, x2 = gender, x3 = cholesterol level. so x is a 3 element column vector equal to {x1, x2, x3} Now we put w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 = a Since a is not a probability, we will have to put it through the logistic function for it to output a number from 0 to 1 (a probability). We then put it through the logistic function, sigma = 1/(1+e-a) where a is defined as above. This will allow a to be represented as a percentage, and that percentage will become our probability representing the chances of death in 10 years. My question: mathematically, how does the model determine w? I don't quite get what to do. the x values given as that's our input, but how do we find w0, w1, w2 and w3 in this situation?  submitted by /u/staychylenn [link] [comments]
