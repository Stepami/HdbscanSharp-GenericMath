An old political joke from Imperial Russia (reign of Nicholas II)
A man yells in the street: "Nicholas is a moron!". He is taken away by the police on charges of lese majeste (insulting the monarch). He tells the policemen "Please let me go, I meant another Nicholas!". The police chief replies: "Do not lie. If you said 'moron', you certainly meant the Czar!"  submitted by /u/Reza_Jafari [link] [comments]
