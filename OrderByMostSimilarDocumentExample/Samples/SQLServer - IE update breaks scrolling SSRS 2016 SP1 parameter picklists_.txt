IE update breaks scrolling SSRS 2016 SP1 parameter picklists?
We've installed October's critical updates, including an update of IE, and have found that SSRS parameter picklists immediately close when trying to click onto the scrollbar to scroll up/down. We use terminal services to publish applications, so all all our users are running this updated version of IE to access the SSRS reports. My PC hadn't yet been updated, and I was able to scroll with the mouse. But on installing KB4040685, I have the same issue. Users can use the scroll wheel or click into the picklist to get it in focus and then use the up/down/pageup/pagedown keys to scroll up down as a temporary workaround. Our SSRS server is 2016 SP1 fully patched. Anyone else having this issue and any advice on fixing? edit: I've had an update from MS - this is a known issue with this IE update (KB4040685) and they are investigating. They provided the same workaround of the mouse wheel and also using the developer tools (F12) to set emulation to IE10 (which only works as long as you keep developer tools open). I'll post back once they have a solution!  submitted by /u/Luinnar [link] [comments]
