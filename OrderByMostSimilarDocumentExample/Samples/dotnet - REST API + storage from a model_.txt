REST API + storage from a model?
Is there anything out there (.Net or .Net Core) where I can just define a model and let some scaffolding generate a backend + REST API per model? (Not auto-generated code) I'm envisioning routes to get, query, create, delete etc backed by some relational DB. I get that .NET + EF gets you most of the way there, but the fact I have to write these controllers and query implementations for each model seems silly. (I know inheritance + generics can simplify this to just a bit of code but still!) I found myself writing my own pipeline, overriding controller factories and writing EF boilerplate then thought, "Someone has to have already built this better than me".  submitted by /u/dave-the-mechanic [link] [comments]
