How do you learn Visual Basic on the internet?
I'm looking everywhere for up to date Visual Basic tutorials and learning resources. I can hardly find anything outside of tutorials of the very basic syntax. Very little in the way of actually showing you how to use the .NET Framework. Specifically, I'm looking for a tutorial on how to build a website in Visual Basic with ASP.NET and I'm coming up with literally nothing. Any resource would be helpful though. Failing that, will I have an easier time learning Visual Basic later if I just go through C# tutorials instead? Jesus, I can't believe that anyone still uses this language with how little there is on the internet about it.  submitted by /u/Sickysuck [link] [comments]
