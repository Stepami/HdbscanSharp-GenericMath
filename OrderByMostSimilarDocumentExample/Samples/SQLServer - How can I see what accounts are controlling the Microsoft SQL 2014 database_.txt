How can I see what accounts are controlling the Microsoft SQL 2014 database?
I have a SQL server I just moved, and it is being used by a program called Education Edge. It isn't backing up. To fix this, I need to need to manually add the accounts the SQL server is using to have Full NTFS permissions to the folder the backups are going to. I went to the services.msc and added all the accounts which mentioned a process starting with SQL. Still not backing up, so I am guessing I am missing one. How do I find out what accounts are being used? Thanks  submitted by /u/wookie7904 [link] [comments]
