Hey Reddit. We are Nevada Health Link, Nevada’s state agency that helps individuals obtain affordable health coverage through our online marketplace. We’re the only place where Nevadan consumers can get connected to federal tax credits and subsidies to help pay your insurance premiums. Our mission is to help all Nevadans get insured. We connect you with budget-friendly health plan options. And, because we’re local, we have in-person assisters available to help simplify the enrollment process. We know that health insurance enrollment can seem like a daunting process, so we’re hosting this AMA series to answer your questions. The 2018 open enrollment window begins today, Nov. 1, 2017, and lasts through Dec. 15, 2017, at midnight. Here are a few examples of questions we can help you with: Why do I need insurance? Who is eligible to enroll? How do I enroll?  What we can't answer questions about: Political questions regarding health care and insurance. We’re a nonpartisan organization focused on getting consumers to enroll. We will have a team of individuals answering questions, so participation might fluctuate depending on schedules. We will do our best to answer questions and respond in a timely manner. If we can’t provide an answer, we will do our best to redirect you to a resource that can. We are your local Exchange and we really want to help you protect yourself and your families by finding the coverage that is right for you.
