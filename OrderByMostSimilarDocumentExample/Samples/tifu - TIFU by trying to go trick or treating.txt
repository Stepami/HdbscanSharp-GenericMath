TIFU by trying to go trick or treating
This one actually happened today. I like halloween. I really do. I have been looking forward to it all year. So, I decided to go trick or treating with a friend of mine. The plan was to get picked up from school, pick up the friend, and then drive over to where the rich people leave. Que my fuck up I am a member of a robotics club, and since we are about to go to our first competition, we are in the lab every day, before and after school. I did not know that we where meeting today however. I tell the teacher that i cant make it today, realizing a good thirty seconds too late that wanting free candy was not an appropriate excuse to miss a build day. The thing was, i had already annoyed my coach, so he essentially told me to either show up, or fet kicked off the team. Well alright then So, already quite upset, i reconfigured my day to accommodate the unexpected problem. I show up after school, and get kicked off anyway. I tell my mom, who then freaks out, and forces my dad to go talk to the coach to get me back on the team. Unsuccessful. Dad finally picks me up, and getting in the car i mash my fingers in the door. Meanwhile my friend is extremely pissed off that i had to cancel trick or treat. What deity did i piss off? Tl;Dr tried to go trick or treating, got kicked off robotics team, and probably lost one of the few friends I have.  submitted by /u/karnathe [link] [comments]
