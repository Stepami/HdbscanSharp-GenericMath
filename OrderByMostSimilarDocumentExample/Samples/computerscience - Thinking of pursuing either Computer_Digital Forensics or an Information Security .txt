Thinking of pursuing either Computer/Digital Forensics or an Information Security Analyst as a Career. Looking for insights or a subreddit dedicated to those.
As the title says, I've recently been looking into either of the two fields as a potential career choice for me. I'm just seeing if I can find some people who are familiar with or have worked in those fields to get some insight. I've done some searching on Google but it's a little light on details beyond just basic job descriptions. I'm just barely starting to look into it so I'm not going to go into to much depth with this post. I'd just like to see if there are people with experience in this subreddit or if there's one I can find that would be relevant to my search.  submitted by /u/N7Nocturne [link] [comments]
