Movies that were "beautiful disasters" like Excalibur
Was watching an interview with Nigel Terry that BBC put on after his death talking about Excalibur. He went into detail on how in production everything went wrong from the weather, to conflicts with the cast to props breaking and malfunctioning. Then he goes on and mentioned that when they were putting the movie together, all the problems made the movie so much better. Williamson and Mirren hated each other, and their dislike made their scenes so much more tense. The actor playing Uriel looked like he was shaking from the holy power from Excalibur when in reality his teeth were chattering the water was so cold. The heavy rains made them constantly have to dry off and polish the armor, giving it the bright shiny look the movie is famous for. I'm trying to think of movies where everything went wrong in the best possible ways, I would imagine there's just a handful that turned all their setbacks into a classic.  submitted by /u/TheGlen [link] [comments]
