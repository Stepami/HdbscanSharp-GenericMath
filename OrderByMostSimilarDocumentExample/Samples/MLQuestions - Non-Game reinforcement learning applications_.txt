Non-Game reinforcement learning applications?
Hey! I’ve recently started learning about reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, Q-learning etc. While I think the Go/Dota/Atari/Robot applications are awesome, I’m wondering, is it possible to apply RL to any kind of data? Can you use it for classification/Regression? Or recommender systems/search? If so, how do you do this without an environment? What’s the action to take here? I know of the n-armed bandit problem and that there exist some applications in search (mostly found academic papers on this) but no implementation. Would love to hear your thoughts/any relevant material to read/repos that apply RL to non-game applications.  submitted by /u/AdamGartner [link] [comments]
