Non-CS Educator Requesting Assistance for Presumably Basic Excel Program
I'm a school psychologist for Milwaukee Public Schools. I work in a really rough school with lots of behavior issues. I'm working with a teacher on a behavior management intervention and I think that utilizing Excel would be a great help. Basically, I'm trying to use his class roster (which varies daily due to attendance issues) and a simple checkbox to mark if a student is present or not. Then, based on the students that are present (checkbox checked), assign the present students to either Red Team or Blue Team. Finally, members of each team will be paired, so that in the end there will be a Red Team full of paired students and a Blue Team of paired students. It will need to account for an odd number of students. That's all I would need the program for. If anyone thinks they could quickly create a formula for this purpose, I would be forever grateful and I'm happy to share the intended use of this program. Thanks in advance from a non-CS n00b who just wants to help some kids get a quality educational experience this year.  submitted by /u/12EggBreakfast [link] [comments]
