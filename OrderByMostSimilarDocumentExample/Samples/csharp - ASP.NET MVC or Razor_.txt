ASP.NET MVC or Razor?
Hi, I am a relatively amateur programmer looking to broaden my web development skills by learning a new framework, previously I have only developed in PHP without any frameworks. Since I have used C# in the past for things such as Unity I feel more comfortable learning ASP.NET rather than a JS framework. After doing some research I have found that there are two routes I can go down MVC or Razor. My question is what is the difference in MVC and Razor? I have looked online however blog posts etc mention things such as view ports and controllers, which I have never heard of and don't quite understand. Also is one better than the other? Thanks EDIT: Grammar  submitted by /u/theothepcbuilder [link] [comments]
