TIFU by hitting a pothole filled with water and having my muffler fall off.
I tried to post this yesterday (10/31) when it happened but had problems... So I live in the country between two small towns and our county roads SUCK. The main one I go down is filled with potholes and had tons of patches where they've tried to fill them in. Even on a clear sunny day it can be hard to see them and avoid them all. Well today I was running a little late for work. It had been raining all day so there was water everywhere. Usually I always do my best to avoid potholes and large puddles but I didn't even see this one. I wasn't going too fast because I had just turned down the street and rounded a corner, so I would say I was going 30mph-40mph top speed. I hit the puddle and instantly knew I had messed up. My car spun a little bit and the back end nearly bottomed out. I looked back and noticed there was suddenly something in the road where I had just been. I backed up and could instantly feel fear and regret bubbling up in me. I got out and looked to see what was back there... Yup. That's a muffler.

I found it fascinating how it seemed to just fall off so easily and the paint peeled like that. You'd think I was rear-ended again or something. Of course I had to call in late to my new job which made the girl before me have to wait to get off. Right now my bumper is being held on with a zip tie and the muffler in my back seat. This was just one event today that made my Halloween quite miserable. TL;DR: I hit a pothole filled with water and it made my muffler fall off and busted up my bumper  submitted by /u/Zena-Xina [link] [comments]
