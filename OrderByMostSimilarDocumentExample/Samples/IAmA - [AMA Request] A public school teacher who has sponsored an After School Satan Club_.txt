[AMA Request] A public school teacher who has sponsored an After School Satan Club.
What kind of resistance did you get from other teachers, administrators and/or the community? How did you advertise the club? Was there much student interest? Have you or the students in your club faced any backlash for being associated with The Satanic Temple? Do you have any advice for any other teachers who want to start an after school Satan club?  submitted by /u/DuanePickens [link] [comments]
