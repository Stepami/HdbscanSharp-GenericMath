Random classifier for image classification.
Here is the full question. As a baseline, ignore the training set and classify every test image by generating a random integer between 1 and 9. The accuracy of this classifier should of course be about 11% (why?). So basically I have to design a such that Random classifier. I have a training set and a test set. In I was told to use the test set. There are about 9 folders each with images in from what scene they are. Now I don't understand what I actually have to do. Should I read in all the images in and just generate a random number from 1-9 and add them to the corresponding scene. Or is there something else I need to do. I just need someone to explain the question to me thanks. Edit: Added the full question Random Classifier  submitted by /u/slimos [link] [comments]
