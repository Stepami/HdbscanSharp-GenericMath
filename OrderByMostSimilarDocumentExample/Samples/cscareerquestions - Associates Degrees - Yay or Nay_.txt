Associates Degrees - Yay or Nay?
Hello. Currently working in EMS as an EMT-Basic. While I love what I do, I also don't plan on doing it forever. Going back to my local community college soon and debating between 2 degrees. Computer user support or web development. I'm just wondering if one would be easier to get a job in than the other with just an associate's degree? (I'd get my A+ and Net+ for computer user support). Any help would be great. Thanks!  submitted by /u/ITransportPeople [link] [comments]
