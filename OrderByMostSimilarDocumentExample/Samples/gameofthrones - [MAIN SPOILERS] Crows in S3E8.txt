[MAIN SPOILERS] Crows in S3E8
I never realized until yesterday, when all of the crows are being really loud to get Sam and Gilly's attention before the white walker shows up to try and take little Sam. That it is the three-eyed raven warning them. I noticed Bran uses the same power in S7 when watching beyond the wall.  submitted by /u/Dabeco [link] [comments]
