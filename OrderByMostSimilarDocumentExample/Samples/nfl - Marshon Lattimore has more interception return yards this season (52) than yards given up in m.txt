Marshon Lattimore has more interception return yards this season (52) than yards given up in man coverage (48)
I put together this stat while doing film study on Lattimore this week. He's having a season right now that isn't just historic by rookie standards, but historic by any standards. He's only allowed 8 catches all year, and only been targeted 19 times. Those are 2006 Champ Bailey and 2011 Darrelle Revis types of numbers. I don't think we have a precedent for what we're seeing here from this kid.  submitted by /u/Barian_Fostate [link] [comments]
