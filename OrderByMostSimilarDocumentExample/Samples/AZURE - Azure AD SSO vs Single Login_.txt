Azure AD SSO vs Single Login?
Is it possible for SAML or "Directory" integrated apps to have single login but not SSO? I have an issue where we have both some low privilege applications and some confidential ones and users don't get that once they are logged in to one you can just open the other and access is granted. This creates issues for example with someone opening an excel document in a meeting room lets say and working on it with someone else, but then forgetting to close out. This can let someone else view other more confidential apps. There are other scenarios where staff closely share terminals which makes ensuring users log out completely a problem at times . Half the organization loves SSO who sit at single desks however there are concerning problems for staff that share devices. We don't want to go to completely separate logins as that then creates password and access administration issues.  submitted by /u/ElectroSpore [link] [comments]
