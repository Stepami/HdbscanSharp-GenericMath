The botting situation in Co-Op vs AI really is as bad as people are making it out to be
You can almost count on a bot every game right now. I just had a 2 bot game. We would have lost multiple games if I were actually a new player. The current strategy seems to be either the bots picking junglers and just staying in the jungle or picking adc's and chasing scuttle crabs en route to a 0-6 score. In a strange way though, playing 4v5 against the bots is easier than 5v5, because you don't have to fight your teammate for CS, helping you get xp and gold faster. Remember, you can't really jungle for the first 10 levels due to not having smite, so you get forced to double top. And no one is smart enough to pick a 2nd support at top, so both players split cs/gold and game extends.  submitted by /u/RaceFunkAndBrisco [link] [comments]
