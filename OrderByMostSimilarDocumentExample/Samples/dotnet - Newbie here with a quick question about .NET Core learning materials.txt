Newbie here with a quick question about .NET Core learning materials
Sorry, I'm new to all this. I have extensive experience building WordPress sites and working with other CMS's but I'm new to "serious" web development. I've played around with Django a bit and enjoyed it but I would like to learn ASP.NET Core for a simple CRUD-style application I'm building. This is in part because I'm entering college for programming this winter and will be working primarily in .NET in that program, but I also just think it looks like an interesting and useful framework. My problem is I'm not exactly sure where I begin the learning process. Do I need to find tutorials specifically for the ASP.NET Core 2.0 release or will older versions suffice as an introduction? Like will this series by kudenkat be a good place to start? Can I use .NET materials or just .NET Core? I did look at Microsoft's Introduction to ASP.NET Core and found it a bit confusing. I think I need a more thorough introduction first. Also how comfortable should I get with C# before I start learning .NET? Would just going through 1-2 quick tutorials to learn the syntax be sufficient for someone with experience in other languages or do I need to become a C# rockstar? Thanks so much.  submitted by /u/throwawaylayman90 [link] [comments]
