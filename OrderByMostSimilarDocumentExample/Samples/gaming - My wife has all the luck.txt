My wife has all the luck
My wife is a big Assassin's Creed fan. A week before the release of Origins, I broke the news to her that I had no interest in it, so wouldn't be buying it. She immediately went on Amazon and bought it herself. Here's where her luck kicks in... 4 days later she receives an email from amazon, claiming that due to a problem with her order, they could not send her the basic edition of the game... And instead would upgrade her to the Gods Edition. That's the super special version with the statue and all the (non season pass) DLC, art book and soundtrack... FOR THE PRICE OF THE STANDARD EDITION! Rightio! Friday, the game arrives, in a huge amount of boxes, as per Amazon usual. She unboxes it, and this thing is a beast of a statue. She installs the game, and goes to the store to install the DLC... But there's only 1 code. There should be 2. Nooooo! Onto the customer service for Ubisoft, who tell us that Amazon have to give us replacement codes. Onto the customer service for Amazon, who said they will replace the entire item, and we can keep the "faulty" one... Wait... What? Let me say it again clearer... They will send us another God's Edition of Assassin's Creed Origins, with the statue, and the DLC, and we do not need to give the previous one back. And they sent it via Primes next day delivery. Cue even more luck here. The 2nd copy arrived yesterday morning, with all the correct DLC. She already had a buyer for the replacement. And then another email from amazon arrives. And I quote... "We apologise for the problems you had with your product: Assassin's Creed Origins God Edition. To make up for it, we are offering you the season pass for free, as it does not come with the game!" End quote! So for £39.99, she got an £80 game twice, and the £30 season pass... Best luck ever! EDIT... PROOF... THESE ARE SCREENSHOTS OF THE EMAILS FROM AMAZON... https://imgur.com/gallery/qWDK5  submitted by /u/NameofTheMaster [link] [comments]
