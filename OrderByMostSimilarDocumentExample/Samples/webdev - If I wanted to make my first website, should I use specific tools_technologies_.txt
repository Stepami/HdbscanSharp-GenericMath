If I wanted to make my first website, should I use specific tools/technologies?
For context, I mean should I make the website in the form of a WordPress theme (or even use any CMS at all) or should I build everything from scratch? I'm a CompSci student and I want to learn/improve my skills in this subject. WordPress seems like the fastest way BUT I don't know what extent I can go to in terms of JavaScript - it seems like WordPress does everything for you, or that there's already a plugin that does everything I'd try to do with JS. Basically I'm looking for a "project" to build as part of a portfolio that I can show to employers. Any advice is appreciated!  submitted by /u/RockettDev [link] [comments]
