Why are Leetcode questions so damn hard?
So, I'm going through a ton of Leetcode questions as I am a graduating Senior and am looking for a full-time job when I graduate this May. I've been preparing by reading and doing problems from the Algorithm Design Manual and supplementing it with Leetcode questions. I've been getting better at them. I am confident on most easy's and a few mediums....but some of them are just so insanely hard. Take this one for example: https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/description/ I spent two hours contemplating different solutions and attempting to find a suitable algorithm and implementation. I made very little progress after two hours, so I decided to look at the (java) solution. What is that solution!! It uses lambdas which I know nothing about, and I couldn't even imagine coming up with the algorithm used to solve it. I couldn't get this problem after two hours with full resources to help me, how can I or anyone solve a problem like that on a whiteboard interview? Can someone answer me this: will I get better? What do I need to do differently?  submitted by /u/MightBeDementia [link] [comments]
