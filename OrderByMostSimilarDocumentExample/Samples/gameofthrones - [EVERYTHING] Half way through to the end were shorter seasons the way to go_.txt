[EVERYTHING] Half way through to the end were shorter seasons the way to go?
http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-end-date-season-8-1201752746/ To live up to the standard they’ve set for themselves — and fans — Weiss and Benioff said they can’t continue to produce 10 episodes of the show in the show’s usual 12- or 14-month time frame. “It’s crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule,” Weiss said. In the end season 8 is less episodes and might still take an extra year despite the shortened season. Considering fans noting that season 7 felt rushed and that elements they enjoyed had to be cut from the show (character development and the wider cast) to fit it in the shorter season...is it ending the way it should or would they have been better suited to extend the production schedule and do full seasons for 7 and 8?  submitted by /u/fearsundown [link] [comments]
