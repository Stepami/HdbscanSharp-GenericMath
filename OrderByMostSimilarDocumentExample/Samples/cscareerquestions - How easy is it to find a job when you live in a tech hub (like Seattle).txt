How easy is it to find a job when you live in a tech hub (like Seattle)
I'm thinking of quitting my job and moving with a family member in Seattle. I don't have any financial obligations or loans at the moment where I need a salary atm. The only concern is that finding a job would be more difficult than I imagined if I were to quit my job. I have approximately half a year of .NET experience and half a year of programming in a proprietary language.  submitted by /u/RaverOfTheNight [link] [comments]
