I'm Tom Woodruff Jr., known as the Alien in the Alien and Alien vs. Predator films and many other monster roles like Pumpkinhead, the Gill Man from Monster Squad, and Goro from Mortal Kombat. AMA!
UPDATE: Thanks for all the questions and comments -- I really enjoyed this. As I alluded to in one of my answers, we'll have a special announcement tomorrow that we think people may like. You can follow me on Twitter or Instagram, or subscribe to our YouTubeChannel for that news and other behind-the-scenes information as we continue our work. Thanks again and Happy Halloween! Over the course of my 35-year career, I've designed and created creature and character effects in more than 100 feature films, spanning everything from The Terminator to It and including Death Becomes Her (for which I won an Academy Award). I've also acted, directed and produced. Proof: https://twitter.com/Tom_WoodruffJr/status/925389196751093761 Ask me anything, and Happy Horrorween!  submitted by /u/Tom_WoodruffJr [link] [comments]
