Has anyone taken the Elite Data Science Machine Learning Masterclass course?
Hi everybody, I recently came to know about http://EliteDataScience.com and the interesting course they are offering: https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-masterclass It's available for $295. I am really sold on the way they have presented this course, but I don't know if I can trust them with that much money. Anyway, I want to know if someone has taken that course, and do you recommend taking that course. Thanks.  submitted by /u/theAIJedi [link] [comments]
