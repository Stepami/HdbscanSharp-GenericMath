Algorithms/DS mastery absolutely necessary?
Hi, I am a recent grad looking for a junior software engineer position. is it absolutely necessary to grind out and master these problems? Or is this only if you want a job at a more well-known company? It seems that every interview I go through, I am asked these algorithm puzzle questions, but some of my friends claim that they have gotten jobs with no whiteboard style programming questions at all... If these jobs exist, why am I not able to find them? Am I looking in the wrong place? I am looking on mainly glassdoor, indeed, and angel list thanks guys!  submitted by /u/cscq-throwaway1 [link] [comments]
