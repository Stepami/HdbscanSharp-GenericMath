How should I approach / what should I learn on my own to create to simulate a sports season?
So I'm doing something where I basically simulate a basketball season with 30 teams, complete with team stats and a schedule and all. I want to create a relatively realistic statistical model around this, where the winners and losers of a game are determined based around the quality of the team, team fatigue, wild card factors, injuries (and accounting for likelihood for injuries), etc. I'm not sure what I should study/learn to do this and whether or not its even realistic for me to implement anything too advanced being that I have no real experience in implementing statistical models.  submitted by /u/Confusedperson12345 [link] [comments]
