I'm Patrik Hermansson. I went undercover inside the alt-right for a year. AMA.
UPDATE: I’m signing off now – a big thank you to everyone who joined in on the discussion and asked really insightful questions! It’s been a whirlwind few weeks since coming out from undercover and it’s been great to see people engage in the work we’re doing at HOPE not hate to combat the alt-right. If you want to read more about my year inside the alt-right you can read my story (and download our entire report) here: https://alternativeright.hopenothate.com You can also find out more and support HOPE not hate’s work on challenging fascism and hate groups here: UK: http://www.hopenothate.org.uk USA: https://hopenothate.com Thanks!!! Hi. My name is Patrik Hermansson. For the last year, I was sent undercover inside the alt-right by HOPE not hate, the anti-fascist research and campaigning organization. I ate and drank with them. I was in Charlottesville with them. They boasted about ties to the White House in front of me. They thought I was one of them. I infiltrated their groups in the UK and America - and I caught it all on camera. What do you want to know about my year with the alt-right? Why did I do it? How close was I to getting caught? Ask me anything!
