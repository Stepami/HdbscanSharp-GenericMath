[Question] Detect Rectangle in a wall and mapping screen coordinates
Hello guys! I'm working on a game project in which I'll have a projected image on a wall. There will be a camera looking at that wall at roughly a 45-degree angle and what I need to detect now are the characteristics of that projected image (a rectangular projection, like a poster). The purpose would be to then take one (x,y) position in the recorded frame (pixel position) and be able to know the (x,y) position in that square on the wall. I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly. Basically mapping the x,y values of the screen to the x,y values of the square on the wall. Anyone has some insight on how to do this? Maybe on how to detect the 3D characteristics of the image on the wall (rectangular)? Or the math necessary for mapping screen coordinates to the image on the wall coordinates? P.D: Right now I'm using OpenCV :) Thanks a lot for your time guys! Cheers!  submitted by /u/JazzyCake [link] [comments]
