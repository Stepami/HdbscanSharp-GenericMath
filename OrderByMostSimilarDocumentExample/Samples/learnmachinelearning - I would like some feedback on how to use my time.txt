I would like some feedback on how to use my time
I'm a Third year CS student working on my BS, and working full time. So with that being said, I don't have a lot of free time. I've only taken calc 1, and will be doing 2, 3, Probability / Statistics, Linear Algebra by the time I graduate. With my free time, should I work on studying Math, or firing up some simple projects and learning Libraries and Enviotments? Employability isn't an issue I already work for a cool SOftware Company where I can start working on projects when I am ready I work. I'm kind of leaning to really mastering Calculus then Stats since I am picking up a lot of my programming skills at work. If I work on projects Ill learn more about python and be able to jump into coursework a little easier down the line and have a higher level understanding of the concepts I plan on doing a Masters right when I am done with my BS. Maybe a PhD if I can find some research opportunity as an undergrad.  submitted by /u/helpfulsj [link] [comments]
