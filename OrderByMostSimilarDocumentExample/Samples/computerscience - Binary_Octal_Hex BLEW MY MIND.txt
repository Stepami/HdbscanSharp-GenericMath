Binary/Octal/Hex BLEW MY MIND
Holy shit this just opened my mind to something I've never EVER thought about in my life. We are all taught that computers use 1's and 0's, but I doubt that every single person can comprehend what that means. I just learned this lesson in my high school AP Comp Sci Principle class, which I took cuz I like computers but know virtually nothing about them Blows my mind that the first people to code a computer had to literally write in 1's and 0's in BINARY holy shit that had to be a pain in the ass  Binary is more than off and on; it is off and on that represent a number that represents a power of 2nth power and for some reason it's read from left to right, to confuse new learners even more ( but now I understand why cuz that is how a counter works, it starts from the right in a set amount of digits and goes up until it hits 0 and then goes over to the next digit and continues)  Holy shit it all makes sense know, nonsense octal and hex are easy now and seem like a HUGE innovation that seems like most people don't even care about. Like it basically compresses all the 1's and 0's that are a pain in the ass to deal with into a nice little package  Now visualizing that all the hex has to be converted to binary which is put through CPU's and such and then converted BACK to be interpreted as things that we humans can easily understand ** AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE** like holy shit that's amazing   This really put into perspective what I'm actually doing when I'm using a computer and that why when you're playing a "game" your computer can become overloaded and not run well. TL:DR Learning the concept of Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal opened my mind to a completely different way of thinking and that blows my fucking mind  submitted by /u/hunter12756 [link] [comments]
