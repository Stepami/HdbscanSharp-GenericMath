How could one go about testing/comparing cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud?
I apologise if posts like this aren't meant to be here, I just wanted to see if anyone can lend some advice. I'm planning a project where I am looking into cloud computing in enterprises, researching various aspects such as the technologies used, privacy and security, cost implications versus traditional networking solutions, etc. I'd like to do something a bit more hands-on too, potentially comparing some of the leading cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The issue comes with how one could go about making comparisons between these services. Are there any kind of benchmarking tools, or possible environments I could set up equally on each service to make a valid test? Sorry if the question is a bit too open-ended, I'd just like to see what kind of options there may be, if any.  submitted by /u/Toby95 [link] [comments]
