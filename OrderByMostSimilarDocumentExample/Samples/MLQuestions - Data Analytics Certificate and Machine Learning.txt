Data Analytics Certificate and Machine Learning
Hello, I am currently employed as a Mechatronics Engineer doing automation and controls work. I am looking to advance my career/pivot my career into machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am looking at a couple different options for achieving this. There is a Data Science Masters at a local university that I could take but I was wondering if professionals here thought it would be feasible to take a Data Analytics Certificate instead (which is less money and I would be able to continue working throughout). The Data Science Masters program has a focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that the Data Analytics Certificate does not. The certificate focuses more on Big Data and analytics. However, if I did the analytics certificate I would look to take additional courses in ML/AI either online or through the university as well. If any professionals can give me their opinion that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks  submitted by /u/Popplegop [link] [comments]
