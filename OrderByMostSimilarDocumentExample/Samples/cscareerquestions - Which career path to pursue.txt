Which career path to pursue
I dont think i can keep up to the ever changing technology to be a good software engineer. What other possible career paths i could pursue that dont require that much technical skills? I already spent 1 year being a software engineer and i never got the satisfaction from it. I know ill never thrive as software engg in the future.  submitted by /u/fishbolface [link] [comments]
