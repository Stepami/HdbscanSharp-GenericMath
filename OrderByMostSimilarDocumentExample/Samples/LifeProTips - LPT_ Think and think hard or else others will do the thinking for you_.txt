LPT: Think and think hard or else others will do the thinking for you.
At home, work or life in general, think and analyze very hard about problems. If you don't give it all, others will come in and solve it for you. Then you will have less incentive and drive to have a go at the next problem. Build grit to attack problem from every angle. Even if you don't come up with a solution, you would have at least given it all. Genuine effort never goes wasted. You are the first and best beneficiary of it. Even if someone else takes credit for your work, there will be no limit to what you can do because you will have trained yourself to apply the drive and attack the problem faster next time.  submitted by /u/lostsoul2016 [link] [comments]
