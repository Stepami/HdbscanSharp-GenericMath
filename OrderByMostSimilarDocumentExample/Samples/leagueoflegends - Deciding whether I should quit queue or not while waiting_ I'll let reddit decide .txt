Deciding whether I should quit queue or not while waiting? I'll let reddit decide for me.
https://gyazo.com/59b299cb4e607e5b8211a2c06a34f2c1 1027 I was actually considering if I should hold this queue until the season ended or not. Currently, it's still ongoing, but I'll let reddit decide whether I should continue waiting for a match or not. lol Edit: I will post updates on the queue every few hours if people are interested lol.
