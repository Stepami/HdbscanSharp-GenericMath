AMA: We are David Silver and Julian Schrittwieser from DeepMind’s AlphaGo team. Ask us anything.
Hi everyone. We are David Silver (/u/David_Silver) and Julian Schrittwieser (/u/JulianSchrittwieser) from DeepMind. We are representing the team that created AlphaGo. We are excited to talk to you about the history of AlphaGo, our most recent research on AlphaGo, and the challenge matches against the 18-time world champion Lee Sedol in 2017 and world #1 Ke Jie earlier this year. We can even talk about the movie that’s just been made about AlphaGo : ) We are opening this thread now and will be here at 1800BST/1300EST/1000PST on 19 October to answer your questions. EDIT 1: We are excited to announce that we have just published our second Nature paper on AlphaGo. This paper describes our latest program, AlphaGo Zero, which learns to play Go without any human data, handcrafted features, or human intervention. Unlike other versions of AlphaGo, which trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games, Zero learns Go simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play - ultimately resulting in our strongest player to date. We’re excited about this result and happy to answer questions about this as well. EDIT 2: We are here, ready to answer your questions! EDIT 3: Thanks for the great questions, we've had a lot of fun :)  submitted by /u/David_Silver [link] [comments]
