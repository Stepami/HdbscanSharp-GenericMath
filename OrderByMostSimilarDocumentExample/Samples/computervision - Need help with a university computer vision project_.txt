Need help with a university computer vision project.
I am 3rd year undergraduate student of computer science and I was tasked with implementing a simple visual recognition problem. The task is detecting teeth from pictures and indentifying the age of the person with Faster R-CNN. Since i am quite the beginner in deep learning and computer vision, I am wondering if there are any implementations that are ready to be trained on these particular pictures and are able to both propose the regions of picture in which teeth are and predict the age of the person? The project should be implemented in tensorflow within a docker container. Thank you very much.  submitted by /u/deephomer [link] [comments]
