Career Transition
I am a software developer with a few years of experience. I became intrigued with AI a while ago and have been considering the shift to a machine learning position ever since. I have read several books on deep learning and have taken multiple online courses. I just finished the first course of the deeplearning.ai specialization on Coursera and I absolutely loved it! I am now convinced that I want to work in machine learning once I have finished the specialization. My question is, how difficult is it to find a machine learning job without a Masters or a PhD? I have heard / read mixed answers to this question. I have heard that some companies wont even look at a candidate if they don't at least have a masters degree. Are online courses enough for me to demonstrate my knowledge / abilities? I am good with Node, React, Python, the AWS platform, Apache Spark, C and serverless architectures. Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to be asking this question. Please let me know if it would be more appropriate for me to post this elsewhere.  submitted by /u/country_dev [link] [comments]
