I’m Warwick Davis. Ewok, Hogwarts Professor, Leprechaun, Tenable quiz show host…AMA!
Thanks for all your questions. I'm sorry I didn't get through them all in the time I had. If you get a chance, tune into Tenable, weekdays at 3pm on ITV. And if you enjoy a musical, check out Eugenius! www.eugeniusthemusical.com. Cheers and I'll see ya in the movies! Hey reddit, Warwick Davis here. I've been lucky enough to work on some of the greatest sci-fi, adventure, and fantasy films of all time, including Star Wars, Harry Potter, Willow and Labrynth. I am currently hosting ITV's quiz show Tenable on every day at 3pm, as well as producing a new musical called Eugenius! Alright, I think that's it! Ask me anything!
