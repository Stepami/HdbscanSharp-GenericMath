[D] How to detect orientation of objects?
I want to simultaneously detect objects within a scene, and also know their orientation using an ANN. This could be done by regressing on two scalars (for each pixel). One is orientation angle, and the other is existence probability. Are there any other mentionable approaches for this? My problem is actually more contrived, as there could be multiple objects with different orientation at the same position, and I need to count them. But I'd be happy with some pointers for the base case.  submitted by /u/austeritygirlone [link] [comments]
