TIFU By flirting with my supervisors Mistress
I work at a factory and went to Another department to kill some time and talk to an older lady. Keeping this a bit vague to avoid specific details and retain anonymity. Let's call her Misses C, she's engaged but not to my supervisor and all our parts go to her before the get to my department. We'll call my supervisor Mr. S he's married. He's usually laid back and doesn't mind if I take awhile to relax after completing my tasks. I talk to Mrs. C about work and random stuff of no significance she tells me if Mr. S asks I'm talking about what parts to get next. Mr. S sees this and believes me to be making a move on his territory (I knew there was something between the two but only confirmed it after this). While I was talking to her he calls me over and asks about specific tasks that I usually do and I tell him they're done. I don't bring up what I was talking about with Mrs. C without being asked to avoid making myself look guilty. Mr. S then proceeds to give me 2 dozen orders of oiled parts to clean. Now this may not sound that bad but the regular washing machine is down and doing 15 orders of parts takes less than 30 minutes with this machine. I have to clean 24 orders of oiled parts (90 parts per order) one order at a time using 409 and water and it takes me and my coworker 4 hours total to do (these parts are not urgent). Then an additional 8 orders I was just given and must do alone (these are urgent). Tldr: I had causal conversation with my supervisors mistress and was given 4 hours of mundane and unnecessary work as punishment then have to do an hour and a half of work that is urgent after cleaning other parts.  submitted by /u/Bio_Hazard124 [link] [comments]
