The Philadelphia 76ers are .500 for the first time since November 15th 2013.
The last time they were .500 or above was when they were 5-5 after a loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Here are the stats from that game. Coincidentally they just hit .500 by winning against the Hawks. TTP  submitted by /u/_Scopes_ [link] [comments]
