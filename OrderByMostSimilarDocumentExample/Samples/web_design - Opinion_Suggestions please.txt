Opinion/Suggestions please
I have an important form page on my real estate website http://reny.net at http://reny.net/first-look-1f-area-Albany.html The page is getting a wicked bounce rate ever since I converted it to bootstrap. I am at a loss as to why except that it seems to present too many boxes (choices) all at once. I am at a loss as to how to redesign this to make it more accessible. One idea might be to present each selection individually. start with the number of bedrooms needed, baths and then price range. Then on to the next criteria which is the most important: location location location. This can be selected in one of three ways: municipality, school district or radius around an address. Then on to options and finally delivery instructions. I often get people who try to fill out all three of the location parameters instead of just one of the three as indicated. I have code to gray out the ones not selected but am not sure if that would help or just further confuse. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  submitted by /u/DennisJM [link] [comments]
