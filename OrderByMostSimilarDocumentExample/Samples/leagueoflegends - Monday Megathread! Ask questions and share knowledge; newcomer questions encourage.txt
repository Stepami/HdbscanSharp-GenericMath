Monday Megathread! Ask questions and share knowledge; newcomer questions encouraged!
Welcome to the latest Monday Megathread, where you the community get to ask your questions and share your knowledge. This is an opportunity for the more experienced LoL players here to share some of your wisdom with those with less expertise. This thread will be a weekly safehaven for those "noobish" questions you may have been too scared to ask for fear of downvotes, but also can be a great place for in depth discussion if you so wish. So, don't hold back, get your game related questions ready and post away, and hopefully someone can answer them!
