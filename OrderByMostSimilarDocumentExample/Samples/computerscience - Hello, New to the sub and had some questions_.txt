Hello, New to the sub and had some questions.
Hello, I am new to the sub, and reddit as well, and I would just like some insight about cs. I am currently an upper level senior at my 4 year college, and at the last minute decided to add cs as a major. I'm taking the very first cs course at my school now, and I need to learn as much as I can about how coding a bunch of stars into existence on the screen infront of me will turn into a job and if this is a practical way to learn coding. Since I am an upper level senior, should I just graduate and learn coding at home? Or would you recommend getting a second bachelors in cs? I don't think my GPA is good enough to make it into a Master's program, so what are your views on this?  submitted by /u/Slimshady1356 [link] [comments]
