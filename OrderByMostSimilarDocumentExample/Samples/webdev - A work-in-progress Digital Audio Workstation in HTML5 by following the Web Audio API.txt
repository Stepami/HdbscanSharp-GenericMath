A work-in-progress Digital Audio Workstation in HTML5 by following the Web Audio API
Hi, GridSound is a work-in-progress HTML5 DAW who follows the Web Audio API (it stays at least compatible with the updated Chrome and Firefox). You can test it here at gridsound.github.io/daw, please keep in mind there is still a huge lack of features. For the moment only all the basic UI mechanisms are ready this means undo/redo, open/save/export, a piano roll and play/pause/loop. But in the future maybe we will have a complete mixer with effects, automatisation, and a synthetiser full options etc. Any kind of contribution are welcome :) Content links: * The landing page: gridsound.com * The main DAW repo: gridsound/daw * The UI components collection: gridsound/gs-ui-components * Our (minimal) Web Audio library: gridsound/gs-webaudio-library Conception links: * The UI components' tree dependency * The *.gs save JSON format  submitted by /u/Mr21_ [link] [comments]
