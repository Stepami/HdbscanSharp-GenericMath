How important is your MS research area once you are looking for a job?
I'm working on my MS in CS with no intention of going for my PhD or working in academia or research. I'm at the point where I need to pick a research area, and an opportunity has opened up to me that is entirely theory/math based. There would be very little implementation involved, it's mostly theoretical and would involve mathematical proofs. If I want to go work in the industry, is this a bad idea? Should I try to find something more relevant? What would even be more relevant?  submitted by /u/PM_ME_YOUR_MECH [link] [comments]
