LPT: When a kid falls over or bumps themself don't say "Are you okay?!" say "You're okay!"
If they're not, they'll cry anyway, if they are they just get up and move on. If you ask then they will think about it and look for a reason to cry, and notice small pain. Edit: To clarify since I wasn't clear enough to start with, I mean a small bump or trip - the kind where they would stand straight back up and keep on running if they were playing with someone else or distracted by something, no bruise, no mark, just oops I tripped. The kind where they don't even react until they look over at someone to see - if someone else (esp. adult) thinks they might be hurt then they must be and need to cry. If a kid's just destroyed themself on the floor and is lying in a puddle of blood you don't just repeatedly tell them it's fine and expect them to carry on. There are kids at work who will stumble, not even fall down and then cry because "it hurts". We can never get to the bottom of what hurts because nothing does, they haven't hurt themselves, and are just crying because stumbles are some huge deal we need to be really worried about. If a kid is okay, reminding them that and keeping them calm is gonna stop the waterworks and not damage them. As someone who was forced to repress and deny every sort of emotion through growing up, being told you're okay when you are is always good.  submitted by /u/orionthebearcub [link] [comments]
