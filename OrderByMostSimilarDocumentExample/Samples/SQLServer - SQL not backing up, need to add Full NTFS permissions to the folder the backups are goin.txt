SQL not backing up, need to add Full NTFS permissions to the folder the backups are going to....help
I need to add some SQL accounts to a folder I am trying to backup the SQL database to. I recently transferred a SQL database to a new server. (SQL is being run by a turd of a program called Financial Edge, and backups are failing.) For some reason when I got through the process of adding these permissions to the backup folder the names of the accounts are not auto-populating, I can't find them when doing a search either. It's names like NT Service\SQLSERVERAGENT, NT Service\SQL Server Distribution etc. How do I go about adding these accounts? Thanks  submitted by /u/wookie7904 [link] [comments]
