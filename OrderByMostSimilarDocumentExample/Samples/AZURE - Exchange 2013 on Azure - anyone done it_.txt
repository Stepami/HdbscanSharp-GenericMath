Exchange 2013 on Azure - anyone done it?
Now that it is supported, we are considering a trial of Exchange 2013 using Azure VMs. I have some questions as there seems to be very little guidance:- 1) Is there an Azure specific Exchange calculator anywhere? The D1, D11 etc., VMs don't translate so well in the normal calculator 2) Has anyone tried splitting a DAG using premium disk across two Azure locations? 3) Is the Edge Transport role still required (if that's what we use currently) or does Azure / EOP provide a different method for malware&hygiene?
