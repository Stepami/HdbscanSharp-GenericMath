(x-post from r/neuroscience) Is computational neuroscience a good degree for getting into AI?
Hello, So a little bit of background before I get into things. I currently work full time as a webdeveloper at a Law Firm in NYC and have some good coding experience. I am not the best with c++, or python but am currently learning. (I mostly know PHP, html, css, and java). Anywho, I previously went to Marist College for computer science, but I did not finish got about 45 credits before I decided I did not want to go there anymore. But now I want to go back to College and artificial intelligence and artificial cognitive thinking (don't believe this exist yet) really interest me. My question is I found a degree at The University of Washington State, and a few others that I probably wouldn't get into on computational neuroscience. And I was wondering if anyone on here has a degree in this and what the job search and what sort of field you ended up in. A lot of stuff I am finding online it seems that people tend to go into business analytics and that is something I do not want to do. TL:DR is computational neuroscience a worthwhile major to get into a field revolving around AI.  submitted by /u/Rucer44 [link] [comments]
