My name is Michael Okon and I went from self-publishing books to getting a two-book publishing deal, with interest from a major Hollywood producer. AMA Reddit!
Happy Halloween Redditors! I have written and self-published 3 self-help books and 15 fiction books under the pen names Michael Samuels and Michael Phillip Cash. Since my last self-published book, I have gotten a literary agent, an entertainment attorney, a film agent and a publicist. I have been signed by WordFire Press in a two-book publishing deal. One major Hollywood producer is currently shopping my book to the studios. Ask me anything! Proof: Twitter Proof: Instagram  submitted by /u/MichaelOkon [link] [comments]
