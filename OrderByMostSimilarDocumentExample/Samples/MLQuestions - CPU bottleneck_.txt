CPU bottleneck?
While training my seq2seq model, I have noticed my computer will lag especially when I use slack or chrome. At first, I thought this was a result of using my GPU for both training and displaying to my monitors. So I switched my monitors to the mobos built in gpu but the lag was still present. I then wondered if I was running out of ram but that was not the case; my ram usage peaked at 50%. From what I can tell, training my model and running slack or chrome causes all 4 of my cpu cores to hit 100%. Normally, the cores would 'quiet back down once slack has loaded but this doesnt seem to happen when I am also trainig a large model. Eventually, the maxed out cores cause a cuda runtime (6) error aka halting my training. The cpu seems to be the issue but I can't tell if I need more cores or just a higher performance cpu.
