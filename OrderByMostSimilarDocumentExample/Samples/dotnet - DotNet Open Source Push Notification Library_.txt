DotNet Open Source Push Notification Library?
I'd like to integrate push notifications in one of our services. Is there an open source active push notification library that works on the server side for dotnet? Everything I have found seems to be dead or hasn't been worked on in over a year. At the moment, I only need APNS but eventually I'll need Android as well.  submitted by /u/uponone [link] [comments]
