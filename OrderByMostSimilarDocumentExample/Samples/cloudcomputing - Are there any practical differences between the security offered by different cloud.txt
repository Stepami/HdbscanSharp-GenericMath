Are there any practical differences between the security offered by different cloud providers?
I'm a layman when it comes to computing but just like the title says, I'm trying to understand if there are any differences between the security of AWS, Azure, or Google and in what circumstances. For example AWS could have better security for Data Centers but Azure has more secure transmission. I've tried looking at the literature but most of it is just marketing speak. I know that each uses their own mix of third party and custom software, and that the mix is changing all the time. I also know that there are an infinite combination of Apps, use-cases and infrastructures, so a rundown of the specifics is beyond me. But I'm hoping there is a straightforward answer to; are there practical differences and if so what are they? Sorry if the question is a bit vague or if I'm using any incorrect jargon.  submitted by /u/Manzikirt [link] [comments]
