Analytics pricing model
I'm using google analytics and google data studio to analyse my clients websites. I want to start providing this to them as a service. Does anyone have any suggestions on a pricing model for this? I guess the pricing has to be appealing to the client. Maybe its per report? Maybe its a flat rate? Thanks  submitted by /u/milkshakespoon [link] [comments]
