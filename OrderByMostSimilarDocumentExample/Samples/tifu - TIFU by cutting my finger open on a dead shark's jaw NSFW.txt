TIFU by cutting my finger open on a dead shark's jaw NSFW
This happened a couple months ago, I can't remember the exact date. My parents own a popular minigolf place. Me, being 17 had to help them restock their fridge with Gatorade. So I carry the big 24 pack from Costco onto the counter next to a shark jaw that used to be on display above the golf window. As I was trying to peel the plastic off the pack of drinks my finger slipped, right into the shark jaw. I grab my hand and I see blood pouring out, even though I was covering the wound. I start telling at my parents to call 911 after I take a look. The dead fucking sharks jaw went to the bone of my pinkey finger. We walk across the road to the EMS station where they clean the wound. After that my mom drives me to the hospital and I got 3 stitches, and permanent nerve damage to my pinkey. And there's still blood on the tooth to this day. Tl;Dr: cut my finger on a sharks jaw while opening a drink case, tooth went right to the bone.  submitted by /u/Huntter1223 [link] [comments]
