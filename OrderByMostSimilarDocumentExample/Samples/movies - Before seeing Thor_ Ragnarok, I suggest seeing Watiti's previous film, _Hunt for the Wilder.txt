Before seeing Thor: Ragnarok, I suggest seeing Watiti's previous film, "Hunt for the Wilderpeople"
This movie is insanely fast paced, and brilliantly funny. The cast is hilarious and there is not a dull moment in this movie. It's the perfect movie to showcase Watiti's sense of humor, and is, in my opinion, his best movie. Here is a particularly funny scene that I think conveys the comedic tone of the movie quite well.  submitted by /u/ccbuddyrider [link] [comments]
