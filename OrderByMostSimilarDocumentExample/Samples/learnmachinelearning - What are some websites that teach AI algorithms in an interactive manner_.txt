What are some websites that teach AI algorithms in an interactive manner?
My goal is to build my foundations from the ground up, starting with the low level algorithms (mini-max, alpha-beta pruning, etc). But rather than just learn them, I also want to actively apply them to problems. Hackerrank has an AI section where you solve problems by writing AI algorithms, but it assumes a lot of pre-requisites, and so it isn't much of a guide (for a beginner, at least). I'm looking for something that's simpler, with adequate tutorials, and fun! EDIT: I should have been clearer, but I am not looking for tutorials to play around with high-level APIs (like tensorflow). That's completely antithetical to my goal, which is to learn things from the basics.  submitted by /u/starstruck_21 [link] [comments]
