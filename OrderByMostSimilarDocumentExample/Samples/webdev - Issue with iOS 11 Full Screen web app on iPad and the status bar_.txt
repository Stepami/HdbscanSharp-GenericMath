Issue with iOS 11 Full Screen web app on iPad and the status bar.
Hi, I have a full screen home screen web app that is designed for 1024x768 resolution so it fits perfectly on the iPad in landscape mode. Or at least, it did, until the iOS 11. This update now has content rendered under the status bar which pushed the entire page down 20 pixels. My meta-tags involved are as follows:      I was under the impression that the "viewport-fit=cover" would fix this returning to the iOS 10 behaviour where the status bar was transparent and "floated" above the html instead of pushing it down. Does anyone know if this is a bug or if I am doing something incorrectly so I can once again get this to display full screen and fit perfectly?  submitted by /u/OyleSlyck [link] [comments]
