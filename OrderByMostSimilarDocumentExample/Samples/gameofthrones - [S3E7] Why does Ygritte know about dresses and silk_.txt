[S3E7] Why does Ygritte know about dresses and silk?
In the last 1000 years the Wildlings lived north of the wall. Do they even wear dresses in places that cold? Would they have even known about silk? It seems like in the cold places, silk would not be an efficient material + there doesn't seem to be any tropical climates/leaves for worms to grow and spin silk. No one would transport it up, and in the six times they invaded, I doubt Wildlings would have found silk and dresses at Castle Black/wherever on the wall they invaded. How does she know about dresses and silk? Oversight on the filmers?  submitted by /u/chubchubpenguin [link] [comments]
