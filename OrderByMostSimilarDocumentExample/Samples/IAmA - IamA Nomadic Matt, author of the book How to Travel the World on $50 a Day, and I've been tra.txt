IamA Nomadic Matt, author of the book How to Travel the World on $50 a Day, and I've been traveling the world for over a decade! Come AMA!
Hey everyone! My name is Matthew Kepnes, otherwise known as Nomadic Matt! I'm the founder of the budget travel website noamdicmatt.com and author of the book, “How to Travel the World on $50 a Day: Travel Cheaper, Longer, Smarter," which just came out as a third edition. My work has been featured on The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Time, BBC, The Huffington Post, The Guardian, and National Geographic, and countless other publications. I've been traveling around the world for over a decade. I've lived in a couple of countries, got lost in a jungle, almost died scuba diving, hiked Patagonia, road tripped across two continents, and been to over 90 countries. As I launch the new edition of my book, I’d love to chat about travel, writing, entrepreneurship, or anything else reddit has in mind. Ask me anything!

Please keep leaving your questions in the comments and I'll answer them through the day!  submitted by /u/nomadicmatt [link] [comments]
