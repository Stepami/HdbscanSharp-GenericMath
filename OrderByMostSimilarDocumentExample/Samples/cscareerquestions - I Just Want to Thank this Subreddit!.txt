I Just Want to Thank this Subreddit!
This year, I recently got rejected from Facebook and Google internship. Even after hours and hours of studying, I felt really discouraged and depressed, but you gotta push forward and stay focused. My last shot is with AirBnb, but not matter what happens with my interview, I just want to thank everybody for their input and encouragement! Because this isn't easy and its actually made me a better person in terms of my work ethic. If your reading this, thank u for helping me or someone else out! Thank you for the mods getting AMA's with CEO's and Reddit for actually opening up a internship opportunity (even though I got rejected). Its not about how hard you hit, its about how many shots you could take and keep moving forward!  submitted by /u/Domepy [link] [comments]
