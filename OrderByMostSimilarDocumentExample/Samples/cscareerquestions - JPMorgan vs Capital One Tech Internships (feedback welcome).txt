JPMorgan vs Capital One Tech Internships (feedback welcome)
I got an offer from both JPMorgan Chase and Capital One for tech internships this summer (current junior at top 15 school). Financials: JPMorgan - $35/hr ($52 overtime) with $1500 signing. Capital One - $3500/2weeks (roughly $44/hr) and no overtime that I'm aware of. Housing paid. Locations: JP - Plano TX, Houston TX C1 - Plano TX, Richmond VA Capital One branded themselves to me as a tech company that is a bank, but I'm curious how much of that is true. I do not want be doing some IT-like work, I want to be working on real software projects. This is the same reason I'm concerned (more so) about JPMorgan, because everyone thinks of them for financial services, not software. The deciding factor for me would really be which place would be the better stepping stone into a big tech company as that's what I currently want to do. I have thrown around the idea of entering into finance, potentially algorithmic or just analyst based but that thought has never been fully considered. I assume JPMorgan would be the better pick in this case. Anybody have any thoughts?  submitted by /u/optymyze [link] [comments]
