College Question ~ different type though
So I am a junior in high school and I love computers. That's just a fact. Now when I say this I don't mean I am those guys we see on youtube who say, oh I built a computer when I was a kid and now I'm a doctor or those who just play video games. My goal is a full-blown computer scientist. So what's the problem? I'm athletic. You see, I love sports but I never take them to the extreme but I am good at them and I have the potential of going D1 in college but I've been seeing a lot of people who do D1 in college and honestly, their classes aren't the classes I would take to become a computer scientist. This is a problem with me because I am the third child and both my siblings are in college and one is in a really expensive school. If I take a D1 full ride will I still have time to study computer science to the utmost potential? Will D1 take up my time? Or do I better shot taking student loans?  submitted by /u/The_New_Eternet_Hero [link] [comments]
