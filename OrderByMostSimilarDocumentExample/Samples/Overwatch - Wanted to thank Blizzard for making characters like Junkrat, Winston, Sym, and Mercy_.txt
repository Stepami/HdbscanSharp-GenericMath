Wanted to thank Blizzard for making characters like Junkrat, Winston, Sym, and Mercy.
I see people speaking about balance and how people are OP and some characters have "bad design and kit" etc, but I just wanted to thank Blizzard for making them. They make it so folks who may have shaky hands, or who can't aim well for whatever reason, disability or not, have a chance to participate and play. It's not always about how your comp is skewed. Sometimes, people can only play characters that give them a shot. If my hands aren't doing well that day, it's Junk or Winston for example. If I'm having a good day it might be a few games of Soldier or Dva. Just a reminder for people out there that sometimes people have limitations and it's okay to accommodate if you can or want to! Have a great season!  submitted by /u/Dad_OW [link] [comments]
