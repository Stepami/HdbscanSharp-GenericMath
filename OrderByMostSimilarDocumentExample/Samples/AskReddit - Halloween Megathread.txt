Halloween Megathread
Please keep all top level-comments as questions, to be answered by the child-comments. The purpose of the megathread is to serve as a sort of subreddit of its own, an /r/askreddit about Halloween, if you will. Top-level comments should mimic regular thread titles, as questions for the child-comments to answer. Non-question top-level comments will be removed, to keep the thread as easy to use and navigate as possible. Use this thread for asking fellow redditors questions about all things Halloween-related, from costume ideas, to best memories, to favorite scary movies, and anything and everything else. And please. feel free to browse it by /new to contribute to new discussions as they arise!  submitted by /u/-eDgAR- [link] [comments]
