Let’s build a reddit bot together!
/r/LearnMachineLearning is initiating an open-source project in which we will create a bot that helps us moderate the /r/LearnMachineLearning community. Of course, given that we are a subreddit dedicated to learning machine learning, we will want our bot to be using some kind of machine learning. Therefore I am looking for suggestions of bots that uses machine learning to moderate our subreddit. Please use upvote to cast your vote for your favorite reddit bot ideas. This thread is under the contest mode, so only mods can see scores. Any other suggestions on how to proceed in terms of logistics are also welcome on this thread. I’ve bounced the idea previously on our Discord server and gotten a couple of suggestions which I will replicate below.  submitted by /u/techrat_reddit [link] [comments]
