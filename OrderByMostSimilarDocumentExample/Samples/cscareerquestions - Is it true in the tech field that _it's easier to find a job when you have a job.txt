Is it true in the tech field that "it's easier to find a job when you have a job"? i.e. Will being 'unemployed' make it harder for me to get a new job?
I am pretty unhappy in my current job, have been at the company about a year, and am kind of burnt out from working my a$$ off the past couple years. I'd like to resign and take some time off to recharge and also focus on growing new skills, then start looking for a new job after a couple months. However, I'm aware that in other fields, there's a stigma with being unemployed. They say it's "easier to find a job when you have a job", meaning that you are a less attractive candidate when you are not currently working. I've also seen things where employers/recruiters ask you to "account for any gaps in your employment" As a software developer is this something I should be concerned about? i.e. Will being unemployed make it harder for me to find a new job? In terms of finances and not having any income, I have saved enough to last a while, so this is not my concern (at least not for this post). Health insurance is another consideration (I am in USA) but let's also keep that separate from this post and focus on the employability aspect.  submitted by /u/delta919191 [link] [comments]
