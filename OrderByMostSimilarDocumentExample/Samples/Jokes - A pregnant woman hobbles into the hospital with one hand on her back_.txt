A pregnant woman hobbles into the hospital with one hand on her back.
A nurse asks her what's wrong, and the pregnant woman screams, "Shouldn't! Wouldn't! Didn't!" The nurse shakes her head and says, "I'm sorryâ€¦I don't understand." The pregnant woman's face contorts in pain as she shouts, "Can't! Won't! Don't!" The nurse, bewildered, turns to a doctor. "Admit her," the doctor said. "She's having contractions."  submitted by /u/wackoclown [link] [comments]
