Network design question
Hi guys, I am setting up a new azure subscription for my workplace. We are using it for two things to begin with. Firstly for ASR of our on prem vmware environment and secondly for putting some workloads in cloud with comms to our on prem network. Both to be done over an express route virtual circuit. We currently have 200 servers in prod total. I wouldn't expect more than 10-20% growth in the next few years. I am trying to decide between having a hub and spoke networking type setup with vnet peering (one vnet per environment eg prod front end, prod back end and dr) OR a single large vnet carved up into subnets seperated by network security groups and routing rules. From reading more recent recommendations by MS is to use the hub and spoke model with vnet peering. We will be maintaining an on prem data center so only need to live in one azure region for the foreseeable future so this seems ok to me. What are your suggestions for those that have done it before? Alternatively two vnets (one for prod and one for DR) and carve the prod up into front end/back end subnets.  submitted by /u/rotheone [link] [comments]
