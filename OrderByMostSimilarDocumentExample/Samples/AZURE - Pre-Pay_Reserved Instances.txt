Pre-Pay/Reserved Instances
Ok, I must be going nuts as I can't seem to figure out how to purchase a reserved instance/Pre-Paid instance in Azure. I've had my production environment in Azure for about a year and its working out great for me. Not having a rack in a data center is one less thing for me to worry about. I'm ready to lock into Azure now and get better pricing, but for the love of god, where the hell do you buy a reserved instance? There is a lot of documentation on the web talking about this, but no specifics on how to buy it, and I can't see anything in the Azure portal about it either. Anyone know?  submitted by /u/ForSureLying [link] [comments]
