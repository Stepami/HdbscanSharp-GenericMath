Looking for recommendations for an NLP approach for a project that I am working on
Hi, I have a background in computer vision and machine learning but I am not very knowledgeable about NLP. I am looking for pointers on how we might approach a task that we are looking at. We are trying to identify when passages of text are talking about the same thing, and how closely the subjects of these passages match. For example (these are made up examples) if I have a paragraph which discusses fishing and another paragraph which discusses the history of Mexico, I'd like to be able to tell that they are talking about completely different things But If I have a paragraph talking about fishing for Trout, and another paragraph which is a review for a new fishing rod, I'd like to be able to say that they are more similar. And I'd like to be able to tell that two paragraphs which talk about fishing for trout are even more similar. I've been told that Word2Vec might be a good place to start looking. Can people recommend some successful, well established algorithms or methods to look at? Are there companies that are doing something like this already?  submitted by /u/GiantGiantsFan [link] [comments]
