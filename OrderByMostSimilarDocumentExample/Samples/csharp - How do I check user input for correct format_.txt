How do I check user input for correct format?
input has to be:  :     where is one of the specific strings, like either 'Name' or 'Surname' or 'Address', etc. and can be basically anything   So currently I'm trying to do it with regex based on one example I found, but frankly I've no idea what I'm doing.  search = Console.ReadLine(); if (System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(search, "^\b(Name|Surname|Address)\b^: ^[a-zA-Z''-']$")) { Console.WriteLine("error"); }  How do I do this properly? I get the Name|Surname|Address thing if that's correct and that [a-zA-Z''-']$ is (I think?) any text and most symbols (got that part from microsoft on how to input a name), but I've absolutely no idea how to specify that there should be a ":" along with a space between the two and none of the examples I found really helped me to understand the whole system any better. Sorry for the formatting, don't know how to work that either, should be a ^ everywhere the text goes upwards (or shouldn't?)  submitted by /u/VonZigmas [link] [comments]
