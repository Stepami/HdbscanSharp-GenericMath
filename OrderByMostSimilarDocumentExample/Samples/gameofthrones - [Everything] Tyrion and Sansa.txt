[Everything] Tyrion and Sansa
I think I'm most excited about a Tyrion and Sansa meeting. After all she has been through, I think she will really appreciate him, and who knows, maybe they will re-marry. I think the chances are probably better than 50% that could happen.  submitted by /u/rmmcnult82 [link] [comments]
