Am I too late? Should I stay with compsci?
I think computer science is one of those things that everyone and their brothers are flooding into. I'm almost done with general education courses at my local community college and I have a lot of coding experience outside of college. Having said that I'll be in college for awhile atleast another year before I get my associates and then I'll transfer out where there's a possiblity that some credits won't transfer. Come graduation is it possible that salaries will go down and competition will rise significantly? I live just outside of Manhatten. I've thought about just stopping college all together and just grinding out the skills necessary to land an internship which will segway into a job. What do you guys think the best path is at the moment? Switch majors? Maybe I should switch to physics, math, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. Should I focus on Cyber security?
