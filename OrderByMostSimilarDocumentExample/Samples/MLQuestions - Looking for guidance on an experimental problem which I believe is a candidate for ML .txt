Looking for guidance on an experimental problem which I believe is a candidate for ML techniques
An answer would be great, but I would be happy with some suggestions on simply where to start looking. Instead of going to heavily into the details of the actual experiment, I have an analogy of the experimental design which I've been told is easier to understand; here goes: I have placed an accelerometer/vibration sensor on a curb at an intersection. I've also payed a teenager to stand there for an hour each day and count the number of cars that go by. The accelerometer is picking up the vibration of cars as they drive by, and at the end of each hour, I have a single value describing the number of 4 wheel vehicles (ie. cars and trucks but not motorcycles or bicycles). I don't know when exactly they passed the sensor though -- I didn't pay the kid that much. I've set up the sensor for an hour and paid the kid on 10 different days. He always goes out at the same time, so there is some expectation of regularity, if that is helpful to know. How would I go about training a system to estimate the number of 4 wheeled vehicles that have passed the same vibration sensor placed on the same curb on a different day? TLDR: I have a continuous time series signature but no ground truth information to establish a template (because I dont know where in that time series signature the events exist). All I have is a total number of events that have occurred in that sample -- any ideas?  submitted by /u/mrstef [link] [comments]
