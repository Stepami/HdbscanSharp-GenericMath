Workaround - Visual Studio is crashing for me today
Visual Studio (2013 in my case) keeps crashing whilst I try to launch it today - it's crashing on multiple machines across multiple sites, so it's not just a "me only" issue. VS seems to be crashing whilst loading its usual news feed. It seems that even double-clicking a Solution in File Explorer doesn't bypass this either, despite the fact that it arguably shouldn't be loading its news feed under these circumstances. I've got two fixes: 1) Temporarily disable Internet Access whilst you load up your Solution/Project. 2) Add the following into C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (you'll need admin rights): 127.0.0.1 app.vssps.visualstudio.com You'll likely want to remove that "fix" once Microsoft resolve their issue. Bizarrely, with that block in place, it seems to get its news from elsewhere... I hope this helps someone, Nick.  submitted by /u/Nick80s [link] [comments]
