[D] Ideas about application of CycleGAN-like algorithm
I'm currently finishing up implementing CycleGAN-like algorithm by incorporating all the relevant recent developments, including progressive growing of GANs, and several other ICLR papers, including CyCADA, for realistic end product. Especially, I hope this will result in realistic video-to-video translation. Naively it can be extended to speech-to-speech, text-to-image (like StackGAN), possibly text-to-text and (image+text)-to-image with the existing technology in unpaired style. Here are some questions: 1) There are already numerous algorithms like this, including unpaired speech-to-speech, one of which was posted here, and there was one ICLR paper about this; on the other hand, I have only limited time. Is it worth pursuing this direction? Or is there no more outstanding problem about this particular task? 2) There is one ICLR paper about text-style transfer. Is it unreasonable to expect that Cycle-GAN-like algorithm can do unsupervised translation (another ICLR paper) like this (with RNN)? If that would be realized, then Cycle-like-GAN can possibly solely do unsupervised voice-to-voice inter-language translation with the user's own voice, which is interesting. 3) If you have any idea about nice (academic or industrial) applications of unpaired translation of X-to-Y please comment it.  submitted by /u/HigherTopoi [link] [comments]
