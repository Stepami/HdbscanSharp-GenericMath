Portfolio question
Hi, I'm after some info on what I should put into a portfolio. I had a job as a front end web developer for a while, however due to medical reasons I was let go and similar with my second job which was loosely so much web development. Then for medical I've been out of the work force and trying to get back in. I'm well now and I'm at a loss as to what to put in my portfolio. One problem is I have a hard time coming up with something practical to make. Do I need to create and wire something up or can I just do a shell and take a screenshot and place it on my personal website? Is there a ball park number of how many items I should have on my portfolio? Any other help would be great.  submitted by /u/frost0r [link] [comments]
