Just got a call from UPS for an internship. How do I prepare?
Hey! So thankfully I got a call today from UPS for a Summer internship for this upcoming summer. I'm only a freshman so I'm very excited. The HR rep seemed to enjoy speaking with me and said I'd get a call within a few days to setup a phone interview. My question is how should I best prepare for this interview? From my research it seems that UPS doesn't generally ask any hard questions, but asks more behavioral, and questions about your resume. I'm fairly good with speaking about my resume and my past projects, but I'm really hoping I could get some advice as to how best ace this interview, because if I can get this internship it would be AMAZING for my career by having a internship already as a freshman. I'd appreciate any advice!  submitted by /u/nomad_ttam [link] [comments]
