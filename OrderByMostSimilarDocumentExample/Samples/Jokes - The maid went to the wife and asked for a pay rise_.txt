The maid went to the wife and asked for a pay rise.
The wife was very worried about this and decided to talk to her about the raise. She asked, “Now Anna, why do you want more pay?” Anna: “Well, Ma’am, there are three reasons why I wanna increase. The first reason is that I clean better than you.” Wife: “Who said you clean better than me?” Anna: “Your husband said so.” Wife: “Really?” Anna: “The second reason is that I am a better cook than you.” Wife: “Don’t talk nonsense! Who said you were a better cook than me?” Anna: “Your husband did.” Wife increasingly angry, “Oh he did, did he?” Anna: “The third reason is that I am better at sex than you.” Wife, really boiling now and through gritted teeth asks, “And did my husband say that as well?” Anna: “No Ma’am, the gardener did.” Wife: “So how much do you want?”  submitted by /u/greree [link] [comments]
