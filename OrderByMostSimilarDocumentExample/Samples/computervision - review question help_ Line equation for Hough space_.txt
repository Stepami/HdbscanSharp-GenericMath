review question help? Line equation for Hough space?
Its a review problem I am having trouble with. Can some one let me knwo if I'm on the right track? "Show that if you use the line equation x cos θ + y sin θ = ρ, each image point (x,y) results in a sinusoid in (ρ,θ) Hough space. Relate the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid to the point (x,y). Does the period (or frequency) of the sinusoid vary with the image point (x,y)?" My thought is: the rho and theta are polar coordinates mark how far away and at what angle it is vs the x y which measure how far up and along it is. If wee use the above line equation to get polar coordinates for all xy points on a specific line we will have a plotted wave. "Show that the derivative of a 1-D signal, I=I(x), amplifies the higher frequency components of the signal. Then, prove that even a slight amount of noise n=n(x), can be responsible for a large difference between the derivative I and I+n (Hint: Assume that n can be written as εsin(ωx) for some very small ε and very large ω)." For this one I thought that the derivative measures the steepness of the line. So a higher frequency in a 1d signal would be amplified by the derivative. For the second part i thought to use the rules of derivatives but I dk if it makes sense. the derivative of f(x) will be less than f(x)+g(x). No?  submitted by /u/stupidCSstudent [link] [comments]
