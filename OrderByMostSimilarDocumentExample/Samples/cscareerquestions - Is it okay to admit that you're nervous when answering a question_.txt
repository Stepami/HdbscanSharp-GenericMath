Is it okay to admit that you're nervous when answering a question?
Sometimes my throat gets dry or I pause to collect myself and relax during an interview. If I catch myself doing this, I usually say "Sorry about that, I'm a bit nervous". Does it look good from the interviewers perspective if I tell them that I'm self aware of how nervous I am, or does it look bad since I don't seem confident in myself? Thanks for the responses.  submitted by /u/csthrowawayquestion3 [link] [comments]
