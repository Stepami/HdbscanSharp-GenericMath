Tired of missing Science AMAs? Message u/ScienceAnnouncements to add your username to r/science's AMA Mailer!
We understand that in the busy list of reddit, both your home page and popular, it's often hard to see a newly posted AMA you might be interested in. As a solution, we've set up a reddit-based program to message you when an AMA is posted. You can even select just the subject areas you are interested in! We won't have access to any of your personal information with this, it's a rather simple program that only works within reddit, so your anonymous account stays anonymous, and anytime you want to cancel the messages a simple 'stop' reply will stop them. To make it easy, we have these clickable links: query subscribe stop help Individual Field Subscriptions Animal Science  Anthropology  Astronomy  Biology  Cancer  Chemistry  Computer Science  Science Discussion  Earth Science  Engineering  Environment  Epidemiology  Geology  Health  Mathematics  Medicine  Nanoscience  Neuroscience  Paleontology  Physics  Psychology  Social Science    submitted by /u/nate [link] [comments]
