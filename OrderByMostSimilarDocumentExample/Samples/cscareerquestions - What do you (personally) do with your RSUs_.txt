What do you (personally) do with your RSUs?
This one goes out to my fellow working people who have RSUs. What do you guys do when your RSUs vest? Each year it's this opportunity to make a big financial decision and I am curious to hear about what decisions people are making during these situations. What do you do? Keep them in the company? Sell all? A mix of the two?  submitted by /u/anothercscqtaway [link] [comments]
