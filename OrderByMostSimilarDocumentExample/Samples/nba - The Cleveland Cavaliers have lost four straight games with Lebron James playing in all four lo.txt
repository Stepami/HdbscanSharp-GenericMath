The Cleveland Cavaliers have lost four straight games with Lebron James playing in all four losses for the first time since 2014
The Cavaliers had a four game losing streak at the end of last year as well, however Lebron sat out the last two games. From November 17th to 22nd of 2014, the Cavs went on a four game losing streak in James' first season back. After that four game losing streak, James would state "We're a very fragile team right now" and shortly after the Cavs would go on to win 8 straight games.  submitted by /u/EvanH98 [link] [comments]
