Static toolbar to simplify full-page caching?
Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else has implemented this design pattern for a web application toolbar. The markup stays the same whether a user is logged in or not, and no session state (username, avatar, etc) is embedded in the UI. The goal is to simplify dynamic resource caching by allowing the same version of content pages to be rendered to all users, while using JS to show/hide certain elements client-side via DOM manipulation. Is this pattern commonly used (my own extremely limited research indicates that it is not), or are there some potential problems that I might be missing? Thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/WhyTheDonald [link] [comments]
