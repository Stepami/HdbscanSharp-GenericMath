LPT for left handers- Use legal pad, not notebooks (no spiraling on wrist when writing on the right side)
As a left hander in school, I always hated using notebooks because the spiral would get in the way. Started doing this during my 2nd year at University and it's helped me a ton (Not a fan of typing notes, I have ADHD so having a computer in front of me is highly unproductive).  submitted by /u/Lurkkin [link] [comments]
