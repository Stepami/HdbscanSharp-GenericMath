Help publishing web app to smarterasp
I am trying to publish an MVC .net core web app for the first time to smarterasp. I'm used to my work setup where I am on Windows and usually do Publish > File System. On my home setup for personal stuff, I'm on Mac. VS will only let you publish to Azure. I have tried to FTP my Project directory and then I tried the bin/Release/publish directory. Neither of those attempts worked. I'm not sure what I'm missing. I'm used to setting up a site in IIS on our work web server then pointing that to a folder that I publish over. Smarterasp gives a guide pretty much just saying to use the Web Deploy option in the publish menu, but that's not possible on Mac. Any help would be appreciated.  submitted by /u/derek3191 [link] [comments]
