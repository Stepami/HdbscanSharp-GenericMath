Cannot connect to SQL Server 2017 Db hosted in Azure via SSMS
I`m facing issue to connect to the SQL DB server 2017 running in Azure Environment via SSMS (version 17.3) it gives error - "A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 10060)" Any suggestion will be deeply appreciated.  submitted by /u/solution1979 [link] [comments]
