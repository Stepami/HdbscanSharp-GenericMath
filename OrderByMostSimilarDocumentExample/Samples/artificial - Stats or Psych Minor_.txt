Stats or Psych Minor?
So I'm at a point where I will be entering kind of the "point of no return" in choosing my minor. I find psychology of more interest, but am willing to do whatever I need to better my potential future career in AI. So I know stats is better for AI but is it necessary (to a certain extent), I'm asking this only because I'm quite behind (and close to failing) calculus right now in University and taking a stats minor would mean more Calc courses in the future (I would be learning the Calc probably either way on my own time, but taking psych allows me to learn at my own pace without as much of a workload). I'd like any of your inputs! Thank you in advance.  submitted by /u/AspiringAIResearcher [link] [comments]
