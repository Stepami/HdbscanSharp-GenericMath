Developing a price comparison site
I am seeking advice on developing a price comparison site. Some examples that I like include https://booko.com.au/ and https://pcpartpicker.com/ . I have experience in programming, just not a whole lot in backend web dev. For the site, I have access to product feeds which contain all the info I require in xml, csv, or json format. My main question is how to execute this in a webpage, particularly what the approach would be and what language you would use? I have used MySQL in the passed and imagine this would be a part of it, I have also tinkered around with PHP. Thanks for any pointers.  submitted by /u/matts18 [link] [comments]
