User defined route not in the routing table
Hi all, New to Azure and having some trouble with a user defined route. I have an OpenVPN instance at 10.5.0.4 with clients in the 10.8.0.0 subnet. I created an Azure routing table with a single Virtual Appliance entry for 10.8.0.0/24 to get hopped to 10.5.0.4. Even after restarting all my 10.5.0.X servers, none of them are seeing this custom route. The route shows up correctly for each instance's "effective routing table" on the Azure portal, but it never seems to propagate to the interfaces. I am probably missing something pretty silly, but I am not seeing it yet. All instances are CentOS 7.4. Thanks  submitted by /u/jmblock2 [link] [comments]
