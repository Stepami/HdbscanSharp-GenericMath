Best techniques for detecting tiny moving blobs in a noisy image?
I'm trying to detect some tiny moving markers in a noisy grayscale image, and I've been trying to use commonly used techniques such as OpenCV's blob detection, contour detection etc, but have not had much success. Both techniques fail often, and even thresholding the image doesn't seem to help much because there seem to be quite a few dominant areas in the images that are around the same pixel levels. One technique that did help a bit was template matching, but the markers can also rotate slightly during motion so template matching fails during those instances. I was hoping to get some suggestions on what would be a good process to detect such tricky things? A sample image can be seen here. The blob to be detected can be seen slightly above the white center line.  submitted by /u/HV250 [link] [comments]
