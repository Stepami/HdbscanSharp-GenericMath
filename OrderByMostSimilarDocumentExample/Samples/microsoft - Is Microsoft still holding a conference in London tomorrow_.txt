Is Microsoft still holding a conference in London tomorrow?
Over a month ago news sites said that Microsoft will be holding a conference in London on the 31st where they were "supposedly" going to announce the Surface Book 2 but clearly that happened before so i am just wondering if there are still some announcements on the way because I haven't heard much about the London conference. thanks!  submitted by /u/jibabadebadido [link] [comments]
