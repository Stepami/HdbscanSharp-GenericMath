TIFU by playing with a sharp knife
Unlike most this happened < 20min ago. So i decided to hand make a knife a few weeks ago, so i ordered the blank, got out the oak & mahogany to make the handle, ordered some leather for the sheath. Put it all together with no issues, was out camping last weekend and ohh was that knife good i'd put a lovely razor edge on it. So tonight i was watching tv and playing with a folding knife when i remembered I hadn't sharpened my custom knife. Out comes the leather strops and I sit watching Star Trek Discovery while sharpening. I do the paper test, perfect, I shave my arm hair, perfect. what an edge... Oh look a large dog hair on my top.. I wonder if i can cut that so I hold the hair between my thumb and forefinger and slice... the hair moves but is uncut.. No matter i shall try again and swing faster.. Nope damnit.. Now I'm not one to be defeated so i figure angle I need to slice at an angle to get the edge to catch.. SWING.... wow lucky there, near hit the thumb... oh wait whats that on the end of the knife.. ahhh the tip of my thumb... oh shit... Off I run to find wifey to help stop the bleeding.. Wife proceeds to cause me copious amounts of pain while stopping the bleeding (She's a nurse).. So I'm now here typing this up so you all can have a good laugh at my stupidity... TLDR; Sharpened KifeKnife to razor edge, cut top off thumb while trying to prove sharpness to self by slicing a dog hair. Edit: Spelling & Grammar  submitted by /u/Pvt_Ryan100 [link] [comments]
