/u/Josephsounds24 Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit. First time redditors should be aware of reddit's site-wide guidelines. If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for self-promotion on reddit. Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it. New users should take the time to read the subreddit introduction to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we have to do to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a positive part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly. If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community, you can buy cheap ($5-$30) sponsored links.

If you have any questions about reddit, please read the reddit FAQ. If you are just starting out on your career as a musician, /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below. /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations /r/remix - share your remixes /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music production  The music makers multireddit contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music.

We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it.
