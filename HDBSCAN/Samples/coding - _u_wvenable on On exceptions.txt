/u/wvenable on On exceptions
Still completely unacceptable.  If you're requirements require your site to continue rendering something when there is a missing translation then you deal with that. Typically you'd want to deal with that in the testing phase. By the time you're throwing an exception, that's a defect and continuing to execute when you have a defect is generally a mistake. Either way, the style of exception throwing doesn't matter. Don't throw implementation-specific exceptions in the method signature.  This is just an argument for unchecked exceptions. It needs to get data from somewhere.  Your argument is that no method, no matter how deep in the chain of methods, could ever change enough to break whatever generic enough exception signature you've chosen for the entire chain? And you still think checked exceptions have some kind of value? I wish I could make a better argument for unchecked exceptions than you have already, but I can't.
