/u/MarvelWizard17 on Marvel’s ‘The Punisher’ Pulled From New York Comic-Con After Las Vegas Tragedy
It's a shame. I get why though. I had a feeling the first episode would premiere during comic con. Then the premiere release next week. Hopefully it doesn't impact the release. It's not a easy situation. Respecting the victims is important too.
