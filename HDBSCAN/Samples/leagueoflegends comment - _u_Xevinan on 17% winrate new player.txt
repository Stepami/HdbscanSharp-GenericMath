I agree. Changing your mindset to how you see each game is a huge part to improving imo. As /u/crazycollegekid said, just worry about improving your own play Instead of asking "how could we as team have won this game?", ask "what could I have done better?" If you wish to improve, then focus on yourself - not your teammates. I started out as a new player in Silver 5 and demoted down to B2 (maybe even B3) at one point. I played a bit more ranked and hit B1 before taking a break from ranked and playing normals. Did this partly because of the pressure I felt when playing ranked games. Normals helped take this pressure off. I think normals helps with improving. There is nothing on the line for losing so you can focus on improving fundamental and basic skills without much worry of the outcome. When I started playing ranked again I climbed to G5 with relative ease towards the end of the season (season 6).
