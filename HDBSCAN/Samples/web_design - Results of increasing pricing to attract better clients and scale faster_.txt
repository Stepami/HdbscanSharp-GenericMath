Results of increasing pricing to attract better clients and scale faster?
Right now I'm struggling to decide if removing my lowest monthly website plan would be the best move for my business. It's currently $49/month and it's not helping me attract serious small business owners. Plus I'm not making much profit so scaling has been slow. Anyone go through something like this before? What happened? Advice for me?  submitted by /u/Justinhustles [link] [comments]
