Expected time to respond to an offer?
I am currently going through the hiring process with a company that I have already had several interviews with. It sounds like they are going to offer me a position, but at one point they stated that I would need to accept the formal offer within 24 hours, despite my starting date not being for a couple of months. This would be my first real job since I've graduated, and I am wondering if this is standard or not? I know most of my friends had at least a week or two to respond to their offers. I told them that I am waiting to hear back from a few other companies, which is true, but they did not really acknowledge me saying that. I'm mainly just wondering if this is a red flag, or a hiring strategy of some sort and would like some advice. Thank you.  submitted by /u/DDZEE [link] [comments]
