/u/CompMath on What are some tips for a Junior interviewing for their first internship?
Wow I wan to thank you so much for your post and giving me so much detail about your experience and your advice! I certainly will put what you said in this post into action. As far as algorithms I am currently taking that class this semester actually with our first exam coming up this Wednesday XD And I actually have but sadly they use a different language but I do have some knowledge in it so all I have to do is take the time to re-learn the basics and I should be good. As for the security clearance they told me if I were accepted into the internship that I would start the process and have it by the time I graduate college!
