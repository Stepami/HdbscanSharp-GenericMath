/u/luciusftw on Should there be some kind of incentive to play healer?
Yes I am a support main :) Healers can still contribute without good mechanics, but most DPS are absolute garbage in that case. Obviously a GM Lucio is gonna have a decent mechanics, but on average, a GM McCree is going to have better mechanics than a GM Lucio. DPS's primary contribution utilizes mechanics.
