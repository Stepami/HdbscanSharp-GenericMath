/u/FUKNWUTM9 on The biggest difference between HoTS and LoL.
Thats one of the things I hate about league Ill be a 0/0/0 Thresh but the midlane Yasuo on my team is 0/8/0 with a fed fizz on the other team. I just lost the game, did I deserve to lose? I dont think so. I got to gold last season, but I had to play carry roles to win. I just play league for fun now, dont really care if I win or lose, this game is meant for anime loving kids anyway
