/u/The_Battler on [Main Spoilers] If Game of Thrones was an Anime
I enjoy animation but there's something unique to watching a human actor vs an animated actor on screen. Human expression is powerful. Although for all the crazy shit that's in GoT it makes an animated version seem beneficial for the boundaries/borders of magic & diplomacy.
