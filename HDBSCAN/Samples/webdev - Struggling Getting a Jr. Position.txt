Struggling Getting a Jr. Position
So I'm having a hard time even getting a Jr. position in the web industry and I'm not too sure what's going wrong. I've graduated from Full Sail university with a Bachelors in Web Design and Development, so I have the degree and education. I made a pretty decent portfolio site using VueJS to display my work and skill. I've got some experience on my resume to back my skills and had my resume approved through several career development sources, so I know it's not my resume holding me back. I apply to every jr. position from east to west coast where I meet 75-100% of the requirements, even some where I've got bonus requirements. I either don't get a reply back or I'm almost instantly rejected without an interview. Can you guys help me figure out the missing piece to landing a jr. position? It seems a lot harder than it should be with my background. EDIT: Portfolio Site  submitted by /u/Le_Reptar [link] [comments]
