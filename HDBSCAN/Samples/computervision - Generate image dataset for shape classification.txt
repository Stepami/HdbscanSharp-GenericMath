Generate image dataset for shape classification
I want to create a dataset for some particular shapes that I have. So given a binary image of a perfect shape, I need to create many different variations of that shape in many different rotations. This will serve as a dataset for training a classifier which should be able to classify a binary shape image. I am working with 12 different shapes here (Right-angled triangle, triangle, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, right-angled trapezoid, concave pentagon, equilateral pentagon etc.) I came up with an approach where a given number of sides, I randomly generate points and make a polygon out of that and see which shape it fits but I don't think that'll give me a good number of samples for all the shapes. Any ideas on how I should go about it (using Python preferably)? Update: Here is the approach I have finalized for now: - For each class (shape), come up with rules for generating random points, e.g. for the right-angled triangle, given a perfect right triangle (https://i.stack.imgur.com/JVfx4.png), we have 3 points: xa, ya, xb, yb and xc, yc. We keep xc and yc the same and play around (using random function) with ya and xb. This should give us as many samples as we want. Let's say n - Flipping all the samples all 3 ways (Now we have 3n samples) - Randomly rotating all the flips a random number of times lets say m (Now we should have 3n*m)  submitted by /u/uridah [link] [comments]
