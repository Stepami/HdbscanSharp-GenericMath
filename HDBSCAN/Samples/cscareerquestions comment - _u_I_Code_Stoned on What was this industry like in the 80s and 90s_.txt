/u/I_Code_Stoned on What was this industry like in the 80s and 90s?
Money rained from the sky. In SF, you could open a window, shout random acronyms and get hired. Here in SOMA, around 2pm on Friday, various startups near me would start exchanging emails about who was hosting for beers @5. As often as not, someone would try to poach me at one of those. Happened all the time. I once got a job, because I met a guy at Benihana and we started talking. I came in for a more formal interview and talked only to him (CEO of a consulting startup). He hired me on the spot without any engineering test. But most interviews still had whiteboard tests. They were usually about data structures. In those days (late '90s, early oughts) most were using enterprise tools of one kind or another, so knowledge of Oracle/Weblogic/ and other application servers was pretty key. Lax dress code was totally a thing. And you know what else? At that startup I mentioned above, I was the only person in engineering that actually had a comp-sci degree. That CEO? Ex Hockey coach. In those days, it was rare to find someone doing work that was based on a degree they'd earned (if they had a degree at all). That consulting dotcom went belly up in 99. I left in '97 when they started talking about mission statements and stock. I could barely keep a straight face when they tried to pawn themselves off as a real company that would last. I went the straight and narrow path, going to college. But most people I knew in those days didn't. They just lied their way in and worked hard. Several friends that have no degrees or liberal arts degrees are now rich and retired from tech work, or rich and keeping busy.
