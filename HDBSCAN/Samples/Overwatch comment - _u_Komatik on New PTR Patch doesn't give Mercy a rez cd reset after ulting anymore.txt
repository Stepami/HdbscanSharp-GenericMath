/u/Komatik on New PTR Patch doesn't give Mercy a rez cd reset after ulting anymore
Apparently as Mercy you should not have fun  His point. The GA change robs a lot of fun movement from the character. The point is about healers having fun abilities, about having a feeling of impact, which DPS have both in spades.
