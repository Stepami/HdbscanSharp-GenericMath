I'm the Monopoly Man that trolled Equifax -- AMA!
I am a lawyer, activist, and professional troublemaker that photobombed former Equifax CEO Richard Smith in his Senate Banking hearing (https://twitter.com/wamandajd). I "cause-played" as the Monopoly Man to call attention to S.J. Res. 47, Senate Republicans' get-out-of-jail-free card for companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo - and to brighten your day by trolling millionaire CEOs on live TV. Ask me anything!

Res. 47, sign our petition at www.noripoffclause.com and call your Senators (tool & script here: http://p2a.co/m2ePGlS)!  submitted by /u/wamandajd [link] [comments]
