Just finished Andrew Ng's course... where to go now?
So I just finished Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera - great course for an introduction - and am looking for where to go next. I think I'm most interested in neural networks and deep learning. Also currently reading through Goodfellow's deep learning text. Just some background about myself: I'm a theoretical physics PhD student, probably going to graduate at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year (and I'm looking to get out of academia). So math does not scare me one bit; if there's anything out there that doesn't hold back on the mathematical background that would be great. I've found comments here and there that say Stanford's CS231n and fast.ai are pretty good next steps, but I want to see what the reddit hivemind thinks.  submitted by /u/physicswizard [link] [comments]
