MCSA SQL 2106 Database Administration custom training
I've got a surprise furlough coming up & would LOVE to hammer out my MCSA in that time. This isn't a be/all end/all for my training...that's a lifetime pursuit.. But you know how the suits love the paper. So I need to get my 2016 Cert to keep plugging. Does anyone have a line on custom training to prep for the exams? I have time for a boot-camp, but none scheduled in my break... I'm willing to try to do it solo, but know I do better w/ a coach. Maybe someone has had success with a specific trainer? Thanks so much!  submitted by /u/shuttledik [link] [comments]
