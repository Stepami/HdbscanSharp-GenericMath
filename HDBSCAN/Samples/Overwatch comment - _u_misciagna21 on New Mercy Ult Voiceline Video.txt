/u/misciagna21 on New Mercy Ult Voiceline Video
It sounds better at least but I still think something along the lines of "Initiating: Protocol Valkyrie!" would sound much cooler. This line is just telling us what Mercy is doing whether she's in ult or not. It hate to nitpick but her old line had so much power behind it and now compared to "Oh let's break it down!" "Experience Tranquility!" "You're powered up get in there!" It just doesn't feel as powerful as it should right now.
