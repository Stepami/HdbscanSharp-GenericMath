/u/Bifferer on I'm Charlie Hamilton James, I'm a wildlife photographer for National Geographic Magazine. Huge fan of vultures and sea otters. Today is World Animal Day so AMA!
Did you know that today is the saints day for Saint Francis of Assisi? He is the patron saint of animals and on this day they do the blessing of the animals in the church .
