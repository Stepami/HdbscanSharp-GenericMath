[REQUEST] Commercial Airline Pilot - American, Delta, Southwest, etc...
Questions come to mind.... Do you get to fly with the same co-pilot often? Do you have to request to go to the more exotic places like Paris, Atlantis or Bahamas? How often is it granted? Do you typically have to pilot the same flights? Like every Monday you fly to Los Angeles and then Wednesdays to Seattle? What's the worst turbulence you experienced? Does it scare you? (and do I really want to know the answer :/) Does the constant altitude changes begin to take their toll on you physically or mentally? What do you do to relieve? Was a pilot your dream job? Or, are you military with flight experience and transitioned into commercial?   submitted by /u/PixieStixAddict [link] [comments]
