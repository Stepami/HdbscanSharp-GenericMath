/u/Caraphox on TIFU with airport security
Woah, hang on, no no. I started reading this getting all ready to berate you for being stupid, but this is all on the security guy who made the comment about 'knowing' you're a terrorist on the first place. He is the professional and he should know better. He was practically begging you to stitch yourself up. I mean how are you supposed to respond to this? It's a social reflex to carry on the joke. It would have been awkward not to. Even if you'd just gone 'ha ha' that's still going along with the joke and 'confirming' your 'terrorist' status to a similar degree. The only 'right' way to respond would have beem to keep a straight face and deny being a terrorist, which would have made for an odd interaction. I'm sorry but this has angered me. I think the guy needs to be re-trained.
