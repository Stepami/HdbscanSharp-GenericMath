I've applied to over 500 jobs and not a single response.
I am exhausted trying to get any sort of response from any job application, but I don't get anything. Not a followup call or email, not even a rejection. I am homeless living out of my car, i am applying for food stamps and section 8 housing. I have to shower, shave, and shit at a gym! I sleep every night in a Walmart parkinglot. I tried renegotiation my $700 a month student loan payments down and they told me "At this moment in time you unfortunately do not qualify for income based repayment." The only upside is I get $300 more a month since I don't have to pay rent. I rework my resume every week, I write cover letters for ever job. Yet nothing. What am I suppose to do?  submitted by /u/nojob1yeardead [link] [comments]
