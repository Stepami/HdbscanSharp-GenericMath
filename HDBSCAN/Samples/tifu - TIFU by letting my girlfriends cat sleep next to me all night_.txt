TIFU by letting my girlfriends cat sleep next to me all night.
So this happened last night. I was staying the night at my girlfriends apartment. Now, just like any other night, I was laying there in my underwear, playing the role of big spoon when all of the sudden her cat jumps into the bed and squeezes itself right in the middle of us. We were both exhausted and had to get up early in the morning so I decided to just ignore her cat and go to sleep. It was here, in my state of exhaustion that I failed to remember that earlier that day my girlfriend had discovered fleas on her cat. The next morning we wake up and head to the University. All seems fine and normal until I'm sitting in class and I notice this uncontrollable itch around my dick. After a few minutes of this extremely annoying distraction I get up and go to the bathroom. It is here that I discover a flea bite... ON. MY. DICK. TL;DR. I let my girlfriend's cat with fleas sleep next to me overnight and woke up to a flea bite on my dick.  submitted by /u/Shimiggins [link] [comments]
