Join the /r/LearnMachineLearning moderation team!
/r/LearnMachineLearning is looking for passionate redditors who can help moderate this subreddit. We need the most help in the following responsibilities: General moderator: Respond to reports and spams. We are looking for redditors who have experience in moderating other subreddits. Wiki moderator: Responsible with providing guideline and maintaining the wiki pages. We are looking for a machine learning expert who is passionate in educating machine learning to others  Please send your application as a comment here or as a message-to-mod. Please include which role you are interested in as well as your background that you think is relevant such as your experience in community moderation and in machine learning. By having extra members in our mod team, we hope to address the following issues we identified for our sub: Low-effort posts or vague questions that don’t include enough details to be educational : these will be promptly removed by the moderators Repetitive questions : Common questions can be compiled into a FAQ page and simply redirect the question to that page. Also, given that most of the repetitive questions are from literal beginners (a.k.a. “how do I get started with machine learning” type of questions), a wiki page on how to get started should alleviate the influx of such questions. Organization of reddit posts : With our new moderation team, we will slowly roll out features such as post flairs so that the subreddit is more organized and easier to browse  :)  submitted by /u/techrat_reddit [link] [comments]
