Mid-level developer that can't find another job
It's been almost a year of looking, and I'm losing hope. I currently have a decent job, and about 6+ years of experience. I've applied to so many places in the Denver metro area, but I can't seem to seal the deal. I've interviewed with TradeDesk, SendGrid, Fanatics, BuildIt, Alteryx, CA Technologies, Mapleton Hill Media, Cachematrix, ShipCompliant/Sovos, and others. It's taking it's toll on me - I have a pretty good job making good money, but this makes me feel completely worthless. It's almost as if what I have is a fluke. I'm not sure how much I can press on. I feel like I'm trapped at my current job, and I so desperately want to move on. It's always the technical part. Whether it's trivia or whiteboarding, I can't ever get it down perfectly. I get it - I need to study and practice. But it's as if everything I know and the years of experience that I have mean literally nothing. I'm frustrated as hell, and I'm throwing a bitch fit. It's not helping my situation but I guess I wanted to see if anyone can relate. I never thought it'd be this hard to find another job (would be my 5th), especially in this market.  submitted by /u/codeGuy71717 [link] [comments]
