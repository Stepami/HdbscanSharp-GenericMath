You should keep in mind that most importantly for many companies looking for a programmer is the fact, HOW he/she tackles a problem. Sure, some companies might as well stuff that is very detailed and techical, but overall just have confidence in the way you solve problems. That's actually one major ability you should have gained from your studies. And if you've also already some pretty good experience in programming: Perfect! Don't worry, little things/technical details you might be missing right now, won't stop you from getting a great job and you'll learn them automaticslly when applying them in the "real world".
