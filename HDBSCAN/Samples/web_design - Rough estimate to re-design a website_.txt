Rough estimate to re-design a website?
I'm taking a college course and need to provide a rough estimate to redesign this website - http://hopebiz.org/ I know 0 about web design so I'm coming here for some help; how many hours and how much per hour would it cost to put up a new logo and change the primary colors on the site? The new logo has been created already and the content on the website will practically remain the exact same. If any of you can help me out that would be great! Sorry if I'm being too vague but this is strictly a proposal and the chances of this going through is about 10%.  submitted by /u/Hawnduhfanboi [link] [comments]
