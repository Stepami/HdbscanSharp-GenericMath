/u/NeoNoireWerewolf on Making A Murderer's Steven Avery denied new trial
No blood in the garage where the bullet was found, either. I'm not convinced Avery is innocent, but there is way too much suspect shit in this case to not let him go. If he killed Halbach, Manitowoc County fucked up the conviction by not following the order to stay out of the investigation, and thus Avery should go free.
