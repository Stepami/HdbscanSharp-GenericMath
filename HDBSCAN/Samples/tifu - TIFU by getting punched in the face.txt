TIFU by getting punched in the face
This actually happened over a week ago I was grilling out with some friends at my house when I got a text that said "fight night at the local school tonight at 8" my friends and I decide to go and watch and maybe fight. We drive over there; it's 8 and no one is there. The host who brings the gloves hadn't shown up yet. Some time goes by and more and more people show up to the school. People are drinking and smoking weed so I'm getting a little nervous because that is not really my crowd to begin with. I was afraid that the cops would show up and I would get arrested by that didn't happen. I should have left right then and there but I didn't like an idiot. This is where the real FU begins. Some people are fighting with gloves and it's chill, like friends playfully boxing. Me being a dumbass wants to fight my friend who was there with me but he didn't want to. Someone who I worked with over the summer wanted to fight someone so I said I would. I thought it might be chill and no one would get hut but oh, was I wrong. We square up, touch gloves and BAM. Right in the chin. I'm down instantly and he went on top of me, hitting me in the back of the head. The people pull him off of me and I get up dazed. It turned out that that kid was really big, despite being a little pudgy. I go home and go to bed, not thinking much of the night, just feeling stupid. I wake up with a headache and I decide not to tell my parents about it and just see what happens. On the Monday during school, I got a really bad headache and went home. The next day I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with a concussion. I missed one week of school and I have to make up all the work that I missed. Tl;dr: I went to fight night, got punched in the face gotta concussion and missed school  submitted by /u/willneskrrquavo [link] [comments]
