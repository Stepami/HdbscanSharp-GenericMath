LPT: next time a plumber comes to your house to work, take five minutes to clean the room they're working in.
As a plumber there's nothing worse than being asked to work on a toilet or sink, in a cabinet or a room in general that is covered in your filth. Yes we chose our profession, but we arent animals and we certainly don't want to be working on your toilet with your sons pee all over it with your period panties with skid marks on the floor beside us. We will... Usually... But I promise you, we do a better job and tend to go easier on the price when we don't feel like we just risked Hep C for a $50 cash call. Also, if your bill comes to an odd number and it isn't going to destroy your finances, feel free to round up a little if its a cash job. Next time you call us we remember the clean people who pay well. At least some of us do. ;) TL;DR - Clean your place before a worker shows up and don't be a cheapskate if you don't have to be.  submitted by /u/Lovethoselittletrees [link] [comments]
