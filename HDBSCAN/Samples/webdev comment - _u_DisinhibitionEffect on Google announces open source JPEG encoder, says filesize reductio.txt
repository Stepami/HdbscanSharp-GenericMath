/u/DisinhibitionEffect on Google announces open source JPEG encoder, says filesize reduction up to 35%
It's not practical for most "real-world" applications. If you want to save space, but deliver JPEGs at "optimal" quality, check out https://github.com/danielgtaylor/jpeg-archive. It's like http://www.jpegmini.com, but free. I know I'm hella late on this, but when Guetzli came out, I ran some tests on our images using guetzli-js. It took over four hours to process an image-set, which jpeg-archive crunched through in 15 minutes. I was not impressed enough with the results to see the trade-off as worthwhile.
