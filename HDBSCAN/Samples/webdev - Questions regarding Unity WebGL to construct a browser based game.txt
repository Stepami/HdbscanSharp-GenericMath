Questions regarding Unity WebGL to construct a browser based game
So I'm just looking for some feedback/opinions on using Unity WebGL to create a browser based game. A quick rundown on the game: I'm looking with a friend who suggested unity, to create a rather basic 2d-2.5d strategy game. Where the game will have online functionalities and run continuously (a presistent world). Eventually the world will restart after a winner is declared. Just curious on your opinions on using unity as a development platform in this regard. This is coming from a Web Developer, while my friend is a die-hard unity guy :P  submitted by /u/Vilhaven [link] [comments]
