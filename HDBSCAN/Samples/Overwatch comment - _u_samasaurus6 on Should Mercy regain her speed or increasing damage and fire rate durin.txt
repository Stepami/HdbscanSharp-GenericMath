/u/samasaurus6 on Should Mercy regain her speed or increasing damage and fire rate during her ult after the recent nerf?
One cooldown reset with ult would be fine. She doesn't need anything else. Unfortunately Blizzard seem to be in the habit of changing too much to heroes rather than small tweaks.
