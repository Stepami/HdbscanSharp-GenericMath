Hi Quincy, thanks for doing this. It's really inspiring! I've heard about this video platform well curated you're launching around Jazz, Soul, Funk, African music and culture... Where can I get it? Is it already available? Do you think people should give more attention on the roots of music and culture from the rest of the world?
