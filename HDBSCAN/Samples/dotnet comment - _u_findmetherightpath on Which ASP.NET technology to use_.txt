/u/findmetherightpath on Which ASP.NET technology to use?
I would think about how critical this application will be to the business, and how long-lived it will be. If this is something that isn't extremely important, not very complex, or you will have the opportunity to rebuild after time to learn another technology, I would say use what you know (that is assuming the little experience you have allows you to create a simple application). The future seems kind of bleak and uncertain for WebForms, and it's fun to hate on it, but Microsoft is not likely to just drop support for it. While WebForms does allow you to build responsive websites, you will still need to make use of CSS (or something that builds to CSS) to create the proper media queries for different device sizes. Depending on what web controls you use, their pre-generated styles may cause issues on smaller devices. Since you mention PC and tablet, you will probably be fine. I would suggest something like Bootstrap as a framework if you aren't very familiar with web design/front-end development. If this is going to be mission critical or a long-lived project, I would urge you to learn ASP.NET Core MVC or full .NET Framework MVC. There will be a steep learning curve (especially since online documentation is still in flux if you choose ASP.NET Core MVC), but you will have an easier time with maintenance once the base is built.
