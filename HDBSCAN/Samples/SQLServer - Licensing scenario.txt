Licensing scenario
We are looking at an ERP that would run off of SQL standard. There are 20 internal users. The ERP also has a piece that is exposed to the Internet for contractors to enter data. My assumption is that we would have to license this server with per-core licensing since external web users are directly accessing the db. Is that right? If so, would it be possible/feasible to just have the web piece run off of SQL Express and then import the data from that Express DB to the Standard DB? Would that allow us to then just license the SQL Standard per-server with 20 CALs? EDIT: The VM hosting the SQL Standard license will require 8 cores ... so ~$30k for per-core licensing?  submitted by /u/mpethe [link] [comments]
