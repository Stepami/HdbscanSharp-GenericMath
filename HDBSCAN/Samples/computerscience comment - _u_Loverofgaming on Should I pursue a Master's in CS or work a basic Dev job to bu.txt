/u/Loverofgaming on Should I pursue a Master's in CS or work a basic Dev job to build experience?
That's an interesting way to put it. Essentially I'm aiming for the software/web developer ladder and/or project lead type roles. I've read arguments that one could just work on getting hired by Google and get a few pay raises in the same time it would take to get a Master's in CS and then try for Google. Even still, I'm trying to increase my general marketability in these areas for the bigger companies. Seems to be the most stable method for me to get out of my current city while also fixing my finances.
