TIFU by squirting testosterone gel into my nose.
TIFU by destroying my sinuses. This literally just happened. I’m a moron. I haven’t slept all night because I have a bad cold, nor have I really slept well all week, so I’m fucking exhausted. Taking Flonase every couple hours helps with the congestion, so when I realized enough time had passed for another dose, I rolled over and went to put some Flonase in my nose. The tube is a different size and shape than the tube of alcohol-based testosterone gel I also keep on my bedside, but somehow in my sleepy haze, I picked up the wrong one, uncapped it, and squirted a large chunk of cold, burning goo into my right nostril. The T gel itself is always cold and slimy, and it’s gritty because the testosterone molecules are large and clump together. The alcohol from the T gel (which helps it evaporate quickly on your skin) feels like acid on my already irritated sinuses. It basically feels like somebody waterboarded me with cold napalm and then set it on fire. The gel is also way thicker than the Flonase spritz and is stuck in my nose, and because I’m so congested, I can’t even fully get it back out. Nothing is moving. I can’t decide whether it’s worse or better that all of this is affecting only one side of my face. Now I’m just lying in bed hating myself. Tl;dr: Tried to grab and insert Flonase into my nose while half-asleep. Accidentally shot cold, burning T gel into my nostril instead. In pain and somehow ended up more congested than when I started.  submitted by /u/rata2ille [link] [comments]
