/u/NiteLite on Time to find a alternative to slack... "Weâ€™re working with Big Red"
Hardly anything to worry about just yet. They are just using what is already available in Slack to make bots, just like everyone else on the internet has been doing for years. Hell, the office cafeteria at my work even has a Slack bot that informs people whats on today's menu before lunch time :D
