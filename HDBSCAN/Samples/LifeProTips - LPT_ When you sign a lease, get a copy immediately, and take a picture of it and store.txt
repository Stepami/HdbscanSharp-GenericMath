LPT: When you sign a lease, get a copy immediately, and take a picture of it and store it in an email to yourself to insure you have a copy of it.
A lease is a very expensive and long term contract. Lease problems are probably the most common type of issue brought up in informal "legal advice" situations. Problems with roommates are probably the most typical subset of problems, and not having a copy of the lease is one of the most common complications. People don't understand how lease problems can be complicated and damaging to your finances and peace of mind until problems occur, and often the only thing that can really help you is if you have some written protection in your lease or a separate roommate contract. BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A COPY OF ANYTHING YOU SIGN, BECAUSE WITHOUT A COPY THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN EVEN KNOW WHAT ALL OF YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE!  submitted by /u/xpostfact [link] [comments]
