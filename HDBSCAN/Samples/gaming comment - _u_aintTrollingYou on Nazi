/u/aintTrollingYou on Nazi-killing video game "Wolfenstein II" angers Nazis with 'Make America Nazi-Free Again' slogans
The Charlottesville protest had like 100 neo nazis and they had to drive in from across the country to get that many.  I'm firstly curious how you got that number, sounds really made up, especially since those photos of the tiki-torch march ran by Richard Spencer, who is a total fucking nazi, showed way more people than 100. That was a Nazi-led, Nazi-organized march. That's like 2 per state on average. Hardly a 'fuck-ton'  I didn't know it was mandatory for all the Nazis who support Trump to be at the Charlottesville protest. That is news to me. Did you yourself organize ALL the nazi's to be there? Where there any absentees? The idea that the US is infested with Nazis is nonsense  You are absolutely right here. It's the Republican party and the Trump supporters that are infested, not the entire US. If it were otherwise I'm sure I'd have been one of many lined up along a pit and shot a long time ago.
