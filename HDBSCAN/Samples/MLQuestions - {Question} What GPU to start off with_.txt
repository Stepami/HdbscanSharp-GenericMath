{Question} What GPU to start off with.
TL;DR: i need to get a GPU for a beginning class, recommendation? I am a HS student about to be one of two students doing machine learning. My school's current fastest computers are lenovo t430 laptops (3230m, no GPU, 4GB SC ddr3). Expecting these will, very quickly, not be fast enough i am going to make a proposal to get a desktop/server with a GPU in it. For this purpose what GPUs would you recommend. A CPU/RAM recommendation would also be appreciated, for that GPU.   Edit: Talked to school principal(Comp-sci teacher too) proposal went extremely well.   What GPU that will be purchased depends on many factors and breaks down like this: purchased outright: 2x GTX 1080ti or 2x Vega Frontier, depends on variety of factors. monetary donations: same cards as above but possibly more. company contacts: ?x ??? Nvidia or ?x ??? Vega cards. Could get cards (whole system?) for free/donated. Absolutely no idea what may or may-not happen here.   Thank you Reddit!  submitted by /u/killerall5385 [link] [comments]
