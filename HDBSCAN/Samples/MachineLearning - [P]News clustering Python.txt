[P]News clustering Python
I want to know good strategies or algorithms to solve the following problem: I have a news clustering problem. I don't know the quantity of clusters. The only thing I know about the amount of clusters is that it should be controlled by one parameter. Parameter should regulate the measure of the connectivity between the documents of the cluster, with "amplification" I should receive clusters of very similar documents, with "easing" - the reverse situation. In ideal case, the algorithm should automatically determine the optimum value of this parameter.  submitted by /u/Renton3 [link] [comments]
