/u/swatkat69 on How much ML coursework/experience is needed to actually be able to work in the industry?
I have As in math up to Linear Algebra. I am taking Probability and Stats with R now. I am living in Houston and Telecommute with the company in Austin every Friday. I saw a post that Houston might not be as competitive as other regions.
