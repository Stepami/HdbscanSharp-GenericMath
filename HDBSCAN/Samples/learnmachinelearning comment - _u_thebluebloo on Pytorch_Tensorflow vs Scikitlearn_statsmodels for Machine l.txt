/u/thebluebloo on Pytorch/Tensorflow vs Scikitlearn/statsmodels for Machine learning
PyTorch is a deep learning framework. It gives you tools to make machine learning models that can leverage the speed advantages of running your models on GPU. There are many other advantages in using a "framework" for deep learning. sklearn is more wide and covers a plethora of deep learning algorithms and models that can be run on your data. I may be wrong, but almost all the models in sklearn cannot be run on a gpu out of the box. In short, its good to learn both. But if you are just starting out, its better to stick to sklearn and get at a comfortable level with using it and understanding all the different machine learning algorithms that it has to offer.
