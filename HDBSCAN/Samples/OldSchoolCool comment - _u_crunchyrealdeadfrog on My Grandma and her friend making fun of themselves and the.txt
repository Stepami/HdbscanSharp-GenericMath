/u/crunchyrealdeadfrog on My Grandma and her friend making fun of themselves and their shorts in 1944
I found these back in 2015 after my grandma passed. No idea who her friend is - I suspect she's a cousin who lived near her - OR who Mr. Marble is, but looking at these always makes me smile :) There are a lot of other photos with her writing on them back from her time in nursing school. Some of my favorites are: photo of a guy from her nursing school holding a baby that roughly says this on the back: “This is Bryan holding a baby – isn’t he a pretty boy” like 5 different photos of her and some guy hugging/sitting together/standing near things that say “me and ?” photo of her holding a baby in nursing school that says “this is me and the pretty baby” then a photo of a friend holding a different baby with a dunce cap on: “this is the ugly baby - we put a dunce cap on him”
