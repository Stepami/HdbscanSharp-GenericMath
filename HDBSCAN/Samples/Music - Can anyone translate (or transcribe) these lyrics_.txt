Can anyone translate (or transcribe) these lyrics?
ok so Requies Aeterna Brave the Storm These two tracks from the Destiny: Rise of Iron Soundtrack have some kind of vocal part that is entirely undocumented. No one anywhere acknowledges the fact that there's a full choir part with lyrics and everything for which there is no transcript anywhere. This has been bothering me since the game came out last year. QUESTION: Does anyone know what the words are? It seems like they're in italian to me, but it could be possible they're latin.  submitted by /u/LUCARIJOE [link] [comments]
