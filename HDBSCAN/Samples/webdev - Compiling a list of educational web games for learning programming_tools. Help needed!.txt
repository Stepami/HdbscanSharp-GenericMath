Compiling a list of educational web games for learning programming/tools. Help needed!
More recently, a lot of educational web games are popping up to teach people how to use tools and programming languages. I feel these games are super helpful, and it is necessary to compile an organized list to give these games more exposure. https://github.com/yuntonyx/educational-browser-games-list So far, I have added popular games such as vim adventure, flexbox defense, flexbox froggy, css grid garden, and many more. If you know some games that is not on the list, please feel welcome to contribute!  submitted by /u/Thriver9 [link] [comments]
