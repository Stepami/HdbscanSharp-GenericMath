/u/beefprime on EU Defends Spain’s Right to Use ‘Proportionate’ Force
You're presupposing people don't make mistakes.  No, I am not, I even acknowledge that past examples of independence movements are entirely based on mistakes (such as the American Civil War). What I have presupposed is that making mistakes should not be an excuse to preclude self determination, and, in fact, the ability to make your own mistakes is a requirement and inevitable result of self determination. Europe in 1914, the Germans in the 1930s, the Hutus in the 1990s, even the modern fracas in Syria or Afghanistan, are all great examples of people making pretty obvious mistakes that self-destruct their respective countries.  They are also all very good examples of other people meddling in the self determination of others, with predictable results (conflict). So why should Catalonia, one of the wealthiest regions in southern Europe, risk everything to secede from a larger democratic political unit? Isn't this a gamble with millions of lives?  Its not up to me to determine if this gamble is worth it to the Catalonians, thats up to the Catalonians. And again, they might be making a mistake, but that is their mistake to make. I think final judgment is more for historians and philosophers. The people stuck in the passionate Now more commonly make decisions based on their limbic systems.  I agree, but that doesn't change my opinion ;d
