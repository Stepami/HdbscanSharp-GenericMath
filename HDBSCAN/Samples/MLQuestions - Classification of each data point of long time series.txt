Classification of each data point of long time series
I have sequences of numerical data composed of series of vectors of 8 measurements. Those measurements are related, i.e, they come from 8 sensors that measure the same thing at slightly different locations. The sequences are quite long (several months long with one measurement per sensor per second). I would like to label each measurement of each sensor has valid data, incoherent data or biased data (sometimes all sensors fail sometimes just a particular one). Incoherente data can happen across a handful of measurements while the biases can sometimes span days. Since I'll be looking for patterns of very different length depending on the class, I was thinking of using a LSTM model with 3 independently trained neural networks (one for each possible class). I'm not sure how to perform the training step. Should I feed the network with whole sequences or should I divide my data into overlapping sequences of some fixed length? Should I sample one sequence, update the parameters of the network, then pick another sequence update again and so on. Or should I use multiple sequences for each training step? But maybe an LSTM is not well suited to the long patterns of the biased data class and some Markov model could do the trick? If you have a source discussing this kind of problem (labelling of each data point of time series with possibly multiple measurement per time step) I'll be glad to hear about it.  submitted by /u/Ils_ont_tue_Jaures [link] [comments]
