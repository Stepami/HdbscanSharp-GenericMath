Having troubles with a pop-up..
Hi there, I was wondering if someone could give me some insight on some difficulty I am having. I would be most appreciative. If you go to http://elymn.bearislandland.com/i/newest-listings and click on any of the "save property" buttons, a pop-up will appear. It appears in the correct spot(where you press the button), however it always also launches you to the top of the page. How would I go about correcting this? I just want it to pop up where you click and the page to stay there. I tried messing with a couple of different things and I couldn't get anything to work. It looks like it might be tied to a #saveproperty somewhere? Thank you for whatever help I could possibly get. -D  submitted by /u/donotstealmycheese [link] [comments]
