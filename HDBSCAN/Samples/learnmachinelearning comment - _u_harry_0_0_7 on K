/u/harry_0_0_7 on K-Means Clustering in Python from Scratch
I am new to and i know a bit about linear regression algorithm and imediately i came across your blog and i read about K-means clustering from it. +ve : The code is easily understandable. -ve : But only one thing is missing, details about input and output. There's one csv file for it. But no information about it! Can you please explain about it clearly.? Also i tried to run your kmeans-from-scratch-and-sklearn.py code from your github repository[https://github.com/mubaris/friendly-fortnight] in my juypter notebook. But ended up getting no insights from it! -TIA
