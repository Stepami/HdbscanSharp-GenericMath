/u/hahayoupaynow on Vegas shooter's girlfriend never expected 'violence' from him: 'I loved him'
Does it matter? I feel like when things like this happen people grasp for a reason, but sometimes it's not even worth acknowledging. Watching Fox News, I watch a whole bunch of pundits sit around in a half circle second-guessing whether this guy wiring $100k to the philippines is somehow tying him to the indonesian arm of the muslim brotherhood. I think it helps people when things like this happen to look for a logical reason why (and I agree that there had to be some sort of reason for this man to have done this.) But the fact is that sometimes knowing why someone did something is not going to help you prevent it from happening again, and perhaps people should focus instead on figuring out a way to prevent his doing instead of figuring out why he did it.
