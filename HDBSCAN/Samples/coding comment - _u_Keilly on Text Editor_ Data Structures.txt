/u/Keilly on Text Editor: Data Structures
Writing one wasn't too bad to be honest, it's just a separate scratch buffer with two pointers to where it belongs in the 'real' buffer. Good point about increasing computing power vs cavemen, the gains get relatively less as years go by, although file sizes often do get bigger too. With super big files, or remote files, maybe you don't want to hold the whole thing in memory too (or transfer it over a network). Also, modern IDEs do so much whenever a key is typed that lots of the power is already needed elsewhere. Simple optimizations, especially of something so central and fundamental, are frequently worthwhile.
