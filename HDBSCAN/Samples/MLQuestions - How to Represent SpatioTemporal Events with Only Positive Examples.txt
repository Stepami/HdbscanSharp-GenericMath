How to Represent SpatioTemporal Events with Only Positive Examples
I am trying to predict spatiotemporal events where I have positive examples. An example would be earthquakes: an earthquake event has several characteristics (strength, depth, type (categorical), time (day), location). To predict them, I have various sensors (say, 100) that give me values over time, with varying spatial extents. I need to 'predict' earthquakes, where I can give the probability of an earthquake. My question is how to represent this as a machine learning problem? I have been learning about both logistic regression and decision trees / random forests, and I'm familiar with scikit-learn and python. But I don't know how to translate my input data into the X and Y for learning and prediction. Idea 1: X = sensors, Y = events. For the events, I can represent them as a tuple (strength, type, depth, location), one per day. For sensors, I could show the measurements of that day. But: * I don't understand how that would work since I would only then have positive examples. They are fairly rare. For a set of sensor settings, you would not always have an earthquake. * I would also lose the time-series aspect of the sensor data. Do I need to expand X to include n numbers of days in the past? Idea 2: X sensors and events, y = boolean presence or absence of event. An X row would consist of the sensor readings (S_n) plus categorical values (through binning) of earthquake descriptions. The corresponding y value would be whether or not an earthquake happened with that description. So the data would look like   Type Depth Strength Loc | s1 s2 s3 ... 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... | X = | s1 s2 s3 ... 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... | | s1 s2 s3 ... 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... | y = | 0 | | 1 | | 0 |  There would be many, many rows, since I would have to include all the combinations of type, depth, strength, and location (through a grid?), and all the days. The positive y would be the sensor readings and combinations of earthquake events that actually happened. This would be a very unbalanced y, since there are very few events compared to al the combinations. I would appreciate any references or pointers about how to do this.  submitted by /u/beezlebub33 [link] [comments]
