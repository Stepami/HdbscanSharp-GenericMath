Face reconstruction in the wild
Sorry if this doesn't belong here. I'm trying to understand the technique used in http://grail.cs.washington.edu/3dfaces/paper.pdf for photometric stereo in the wild. However, the result I get (for the 3d mesh) is really flat compared to their result. I think the issue is that I warp the face to the template shape which is very wide (for example George Bush's face has different dimensions than the template). Am I suppose to choose some scale initially and don't use the scale of the template?  submitted by /u/qeVut7tguCpxKqqMPtWU [link] [comments]
