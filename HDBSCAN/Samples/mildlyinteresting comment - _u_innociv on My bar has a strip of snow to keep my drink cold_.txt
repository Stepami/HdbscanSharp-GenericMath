/u/innociv on My bar has a strip of snow to keep my drink cold.
There is almost no way this works well, especially with a plastic cup. The plastic is no conductive enough and cold does not travel upwards. I've not seen a scientific test, but I'd be willing to bet this does almost nothing. You'll get a much, much greater effect from having more surface area on the ice.
