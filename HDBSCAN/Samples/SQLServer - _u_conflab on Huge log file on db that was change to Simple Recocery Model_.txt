/u/conflab on Huge log file on db that was change to Simple Recocery Model.
I figured perhaps I was just being dumb and assuming a log backup had been done (prior to switching to SIMPLE). I've just done a couple of quick tests and to me it looks like a lot of the log space is freed up when you switch from FULL to SIMPLE. Had one DB (very small) with 99% log space used [all these are based on DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE)], I switched it to SIMPLE and it's now showing 13% log space used. The log is only 13MB so I figure that's just some meta data or something that's in the log? I tried the same with a 17GB log that was around 40% full, that's now 0.25%, and a 50GB log file that was 17%, which is now 0.15% full. Shrinking the files was pretty much instant. So I dunno, maybe I'm talking rubbish but I can't explain what I'm seeing if that's the case.
