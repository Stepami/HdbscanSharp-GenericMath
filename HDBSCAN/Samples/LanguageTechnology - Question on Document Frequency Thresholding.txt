Question on Document Frequency Thresholding
I posted a question a while ago here. There I asked about a technique called document frequency thresholding (DF thresholding) to decide whether certain features (terms) really contribute to the classification or not by looking at its document frequency (DF). As suggested I apply what I understand on my dataset using scikit-learn and apparently the library has provided what I need in the form of min_df and max_df on their TFIDF Vectorizer, it doesn't improve much of the accuracy. But anyway, I talked to my professor again and apparently that's not what he meant when he told me to try DF Thresholding. He referred me to this paper on the subchapter "A Feature Selection Method Based on Document Frequency improved". The paper explained the 3 formula used on this method, Concentration degree, Disperse degree and Contribution degree. I think there's a mistake on the final formula which makes it a little confusing, so I decided to look further. I tried to find other papers on the subject, but strangely enough, I couldn't find any! I couldn't seem to find any paper that mentions this kind of technique that use concentration, disperse, and contribution degrees. Not even on the referenced papers on the paper I mentioned above. I've tried to use Google Scholar, Research Gate, IEEE, there's no similar paper I could find, it really baffled me. I've expressed my confusion to my professor but he still insisted that the formula on the paper he referred to was clear enough and that I should try to work on it first. Now I am completely stuck here, I am supposed to meet with him again in a few days and before that I just want to clear this out. Maybe you guys can take a look at the paper I linked above and who knows maybe anyone here is familiar with the technique? And maybe it has a different name that I am not aware of? Thanks!  submitted by /u/sentient_machine [link] [comments]
