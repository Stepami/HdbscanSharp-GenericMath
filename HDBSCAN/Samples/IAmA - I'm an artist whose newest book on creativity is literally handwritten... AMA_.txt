I'm an artist whose newest book on creativity is literally handwritten... AMA.
After years of being "a person who posts stuff online," I'm now a fulltime designer and author. My first book is a creative journal called 1 Page at a Time that's available in 17 languages. My newest, THINGS ARE WHAT YOU MAKE OF THEM, came out yesterday and is thirteen handwritten essays about the anxieties and challenges of being a creative â€“ basically, anyone who "makes" anything. http://www.thingsarewhatyoumakeofthem.com Proof: https://i.redd.it/e4uxtaloegpz.jpg  submitted by /u/adamjkurtz [link] [comments]
