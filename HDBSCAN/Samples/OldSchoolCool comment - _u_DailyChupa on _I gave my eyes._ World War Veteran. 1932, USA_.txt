Most deaths were Russians and Chinese. For every other nation, WW1 was much worse, except for maybe USA who lost more men in the second one. The life of a solider was far more horrific in the first one while life as a civilian was worse in WW2. But as a solider, ww2 was indeed a Girl Scout convention.
