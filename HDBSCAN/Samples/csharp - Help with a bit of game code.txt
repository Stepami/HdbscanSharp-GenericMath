Help with a bit of game code
Hullo, I'm working on a Unity game (which is taking entirely too long to develop) and am struggling to approach bonus item spawn code. Essentially, after X turns, I want a bonus to spawn. But the bonuses can have a negative or positive effect, so I want to perform a calculation on X turn that considers a few criteria: Current level Difficulty Possibly performance detection at that point (IE, if they've been scoring highly and quickly)  Depending on the result of that calculation there will be a higher or lower chance of the bonus being a positive or negative. For example, if a user is on the later levels and on a high difficulty, there's still a chance a positive will spawn, but it's more likely a negative will. Any pointers would be really appreciated.  submitted by /u/happycat_ishappy [link] [comments]
