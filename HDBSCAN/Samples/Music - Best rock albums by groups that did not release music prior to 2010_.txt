Best rock albums by groups that did not release music prior to 2010?
What are the best recent rock albums, in your opinion? I'm excluding things like Wasting Light by Foo Fighters because while it's a great album, they're old enough and big enough that most people have already heard of them.  submitted by /u/neverthoughtidjoin [link] [comments]
