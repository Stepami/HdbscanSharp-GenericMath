[MAIN SPOILERS] Rewatching and noticed a great little piece of foreshadowing regarding Theon in S02E05 "the Ghost of Harrenhall."
Not sure if this has been posted, apologies if it has. In season 2 episode 5, Theon is given a ship to raid the Stoney Shores. It's here that Dagmer gives him the idea that leads Theon to attack Winterfell. Immediately after, the scene cuts to Arya digging a fork into a plate of sausages to serve to Tywin & Co. It's small, but I love this little piece of foreshadowing regarding Theon and his favorite toy. This is my sixth rewatch and I thought I knew everything. What a show.  submitted by /u/Jakethrowsdwn [link] [comments]
