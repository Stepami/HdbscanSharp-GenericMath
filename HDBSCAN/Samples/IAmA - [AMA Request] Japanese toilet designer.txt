[AMA Request] Japanese toilet designer
My 5 Questions: How did you get into the toilet design business? What is one of your favorite features on a toilet you have designed? How do you decide what features to use - personal experience, focus groups, etc.? Any chance your designs might make their way out of Asia? In your wildest dreams, what is the most amazing feature a toilet could have?  Public Contact Information: If Applicable  submitted by /u/hazel_mary [link] [comments]
