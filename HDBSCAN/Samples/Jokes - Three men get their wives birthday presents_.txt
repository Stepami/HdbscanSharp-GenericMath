Three men get their wives birthday presents.
The first man, a lawyer, tells the other men “I got my wife a trip to the Bahamas and a pearl necklace. She loves pearls, so if she doesn’t enjoy the trip, I know she’ll like the necklace.” The second man, a doctor, says “I got my wife a brand new 2017 BMW and a Louis Vuitton handbag she’s had her eye on. If she doesn’t drive the car much, I know she’ll love that handbag.” The third man, a trucker, tells the others “I got my wife a Metallica t-shirt and a dildo. If she doesn’t like the t-shirt, she can go fuck herself.”  submitted by /u/joseph_jojo_shabadoo [link] [comments]
