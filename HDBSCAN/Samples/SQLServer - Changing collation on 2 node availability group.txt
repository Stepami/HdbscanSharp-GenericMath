Changing collation on 2 node availability group
My company has 2 nodes in an availability group (SQL Server 2012 Enterprise on Windows 2012 R2) which have been configured with the "wrong" collation (we migrated to this setup from another data centre which had different server collation). This has led to predictable issues with stored procedures which have been circumvented by adding in COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT where appropriate. Now, I would like to change the server collation to that which it was previously so someone doesn't have to remember/fix the collation whenever these SPs are changed by our devs. I intended to do this by: Creating a new node and installed SQL Server with the desired collation. Add the node into the availability group, and evict the current secondary Reinstall SQL Server on the evicted secondary, then add it back into the availability group Failover to the newly reinstalled secondary, evict the original primary and do the same there Remove the temporary 3rd node that was created at the start of this work.  I started working on this but as I've come to the point where I add the new box in to the availability group I found parts in books online saying the replicas all need the same server collation. When going through the add replica wizard there are no errors on validation, so I'm wondering if this is just a best practice seeing as if you were going to run 24/7 with different collations it would be problematic? This is just meant to be a (relatively) short period of time while the collations are corrected. Let me know if there's some more relevant information I've missed, and thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/conflab [link] [comments]
