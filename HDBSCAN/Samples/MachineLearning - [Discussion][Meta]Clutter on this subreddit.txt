[Discussion][Meta]Clutter on this subreddit
Hi fellow machine learning enthusiasts. I don't think I'm the only one that thinks this subreddit has become cluttered lately. The increase in basic questions and blog posts about very simple stuff is something I very much think has lessened the quality of this subreddit. Now if you disagree with this, feel free to downvote or ignore this post. However, if you do think this is a bad thing, I hope this can be a good place to discuss possible solutions. For the simple questions, the solution should be simple. Create a weekly post where we can post simple questions as comments. I will certainly use that as a resource myself, and I think others will as well. One argument against this is the MLQuestions subreddit, but that subreddit is pretty much useless for anything more complicated than logistic regression... In addition to the simple questions megathread, we can also have a career megathread, that opens for career questions, course questions, etc. Now for blog posts, I don't see any solution though and I would love to hear your ideas here. So, what do you guys think? Should we accept the simple questions, have a megathread, ban them altogether, or something completely different that I couldn't think of?  submitted by /u/yngvizzle [link] [comments]
