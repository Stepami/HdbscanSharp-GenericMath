Ty i really do appreciate your time and sorry for the lame story but i do i love rs and im sure you do too , thats why we are passionate about this. If you think we are doing this for shits and giggles then fair enough, it happens. But we are genuinely telling you that email support in the least would be nice ( it could be anything not exactly email think of something, more people or idk but just solve it). If you want examples I personally went through this 3 months ago or so and I looked for an email contact for a problem i had at the time. Can i remember the issue? no im sorry i dont, its been a long time and i dont sit around remembering this shit. But this is why i brought this up to you in the first place. just opening your eyes that my experience was shit and im happy for all those other people you helped but some of us were over looked thats all
