[AMA Request] Anyone who is working/has worked in a restaurant environment
Around 40% of all foods produced in USA is wasted today. I am working on a school project to identify solutions for different sources of food waste in US. After talking to several people, we came to know that at a restaurant environment more than 90% of the food is wasted because Customers order large quantity of food and leave the excess food on the table and do not take them home. In order to reduce this waste we came up with the following idea: what if we had an augmented reality app that lets the customer scroll through the menu and see the real portion sizes on a virtual plate on their table, change their portion (small, medium, large) and then place the order? We need to replace the Paper Menus with an iPad or something like that, but it will let the customer decide what and how much to order after looking at the real portion. Customer experience is expected to be better with this change, also the servers will not have to spend time collecting orders, unless the customer has a question. I am hoping the tablets can be paid for by selling advertising on those screens. The advertisements can add to the revenue potential of the individual restaurants too. Or we could have a personal phone app - then we will have to partner with restaurants to integrate the food ordering process in the app. The app could also tell the calories in an order based on order size. Its like the Ikea AR app (https://youtu.be/Arbeh7vSIi8) where you can place virtual Ikea furnitures in your room before buying but for food. My 5 Questions: What is your job role/responsibility? What challenges do you foresee with our idea? What benefits do you see? Would stores be willing to pay for subscription for such a software system? If so, how much? Are you already using any product that provide similar functionality? Is our idea better/worse?   submitted by /u/Cap10Haddock [link] [comments]
