/u/supercrewzin on LPT: If you were in an accident and had a car seat in the vehicle, you can take it to your local fire department and have them inspect it for free. If it's unsafe, they can give you a slip for your insurance company to replace it.
Weird. I live in north Florida and none of the departments in our area do this. The Florida highway patrol has a unit that does it.
