Bombed my first technical interview and it was a super easy question!
Geez, I failed a damn logic question on how to find prime numbers. I eventually got to the write answer but I took so long that my interviewer got on his cell phone to distract himself. I was so stuck on what a damn prime number is! I forgot all my math. I got confused and I'm like wait but even numbers aren't prime except for 2 and the 2 confused the hell out of me. Anyway, I had 15 minutes to get the right answer and I should have because I KNOW it. I rushed and was nervous. I feel like shit. Do I just go through the question myself and keep it moving? I have a MUCH harder interview tomorrow that I am prepping for.  submitted by /u/befores [link] [comments]
