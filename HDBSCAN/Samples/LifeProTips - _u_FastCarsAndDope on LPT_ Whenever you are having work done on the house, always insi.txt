/u/FastCarsAndDope on LPT: Whenever you are having work done on the house, always insist on being told the supplier of all the materials/parts (windows, doors, blinds, tiles etc. etc.) - when you need spares 5 years down the line, there is no guarantee your contractor will still be around to tell you.
I do roofing and we always leave extras of everything partial used, with some way to tell brand and color. Just a courtious thing to do if all I can do is throw it away anyways.
