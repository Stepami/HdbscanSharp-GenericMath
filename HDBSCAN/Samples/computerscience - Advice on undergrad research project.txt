Advice on undergrad research project
I am currently in the third year of my computer science degree and for my undergraduate research project I have been tasked with implementing a search engine that also has capabilities similar to Google Trends of sorts. The only resource that has been provided to me was a link to the Apache Solr website. I researched what Apache Solr and Apache Lucene are and their applications, however I have no idea on where I should begin. I've been exposed to C/C++, Verilog and Java, but only have a very rudimentary understanding about web programming and database management. Will anyone be able to offer advice on the different steps I should take to approach this project? Thank you for taking the time to read. EDIT: I should also mention that my professor also stated that we must implement this functionality into a website and our search engine has to crawl some 900 websites that he stated will be used for searching.  submitted by /u/LaSoufray [link] [comments]
