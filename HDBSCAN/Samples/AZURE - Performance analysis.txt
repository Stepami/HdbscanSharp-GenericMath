Performance analysis
What is the best way to analyze performance issues with your Azure VM's? Background: Using a Standard D3 v2 (4 vcpus, 14 GB memory, Standard_LRS storage) to host an inventory application. It has to be accessed via RDP into a single server, which puts me around 5-6 people using TermSvc's concurrently. It would be great if this was a web-based product, but it's inventory management for a very niche field so it is what it is. We experience occasional slowness with the system and I'm a little puzzled on exactly how to diagnose. The Resource Monitor indicates the network and disk showing high utilization. Memory and CPU seem OK, which kind of rules out needing to bump up a plan. I don't see where there is an "upgrade" for networking i/o. Perhaps SSD storage would help.. Any suggestions?  submitted by /u/Jackoff_Alltrades [link] [comments]
