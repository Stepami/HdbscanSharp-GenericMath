Have a final round interview for the Explorer’s Program in less than a week, any tips?
This whole process has been extremely fast for me, I was originally told that if I made it to the final round, I’d have a 5 week window to schedule my interview in Redmond. Got an email today saying it’s first come first serve and by the time I could log on and pick a time the 10th was the only date available. So, as I spend the next week desperately trying to remember everything I’ve learned about Java, does anyone have any other tips for me regarding the interview?  submitted by /u/westie9398 [link] [comments]
