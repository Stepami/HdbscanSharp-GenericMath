/u/Afs2017 on Re-Enter county without OPT EAD Card
Thank you, I have it and it is signed from May 2017. I do not have the card, but I do have the certificate of approval notice, from the original card. I spoke with USCIS and they said, it comes down to the CBP Officer, but be transparent and show all documentation (i-20, passport, EAD certificate, work contract, letter from employer, emails from USCIS and tracking of sending my card back to Potomac.) and it should be ok, since in "their system" it all checks out.
