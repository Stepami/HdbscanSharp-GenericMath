/u/richcsmith on LPT: Whenever you are having work done on the house, always insist on being told the supplier of all the materials/parts (windows, doors, blinds, tiles etc. etc.) - when you need spares 5 years down the line, there is no guarantee your contractor will still be around to tell you.
Co-sign. We just bought a renovated house and made sure we got copies of all receipts, appliance manuals, etc for everything. Flooring, backsplash, paint, you name it.
