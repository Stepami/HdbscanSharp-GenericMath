/u/Romi_1432 on It's interesting how kids want to be adults and adults want to be younger...
I came across this post one day while I was browsing on the internet. If I remember correctly it went something like this: - During childhood, you are healthy, fit and have alot of time, but you lack the money. - During early adulthood you are healthy, fit and have the money but don't have the time. - During your late years you have the money and time, but not fitness. This doesn't apply for everything, just a generalization. But kind of links to the statement of how kids want to be adults and adults want to be younger.
