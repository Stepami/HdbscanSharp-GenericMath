What is this style of Javascript coding/app called?
The style is: a function is created which returns one or more sub-functions in a comma-separated list. It is then instantiated using the new() keyword and the functions called as methods of the instantiated object. Here's a minimal example:  function caseChanger() { return { uc: function (str) { return str.toUpperCase(); }, lc: function (str) { return str.toLowerCase(); } } }; var changer = new caseChanger; console.log(changer.lc('hELLo wOrLd')); console.log(changer.uc('hELLo wOrLd'));  I tried for ages to search for it in tutorials/coding websites but I didn't know if there was a specific term. It makes a lot of sense to me as I do a lot of work with Perl and it feels like the same as using a perl OO module.  submitted by /u/FiveYearsAgoOnReddit [link] [comments]
