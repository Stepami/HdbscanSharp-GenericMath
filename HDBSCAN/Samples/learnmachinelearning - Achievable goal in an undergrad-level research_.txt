Achievable goal in an undergrad-level research?
I am doing an undergrad research with a professor, and my task is to pick a topic that I am interested in doing a research. The topic that I picked was 'pun detection' in NLP. (related paper: http://aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2005) There were several systems that showed significant results, and my professor told me to look on those. My question is, what can be my goal related to this task? Is it normal to just analyze one of the best-performing systems and try to find a way to improve it? Also, is it a good idea to start with writing a program that imitates what the paper of the best performing system explains? I am totally new to research, so I have no idea what to do next.  submitted by /u/czechrepublic [link] [comments]
