/u/brosmike on Microsoft to pay for employees legal defense of DACA.
As a Microsoft engineer that does several interviews per month, none of the things you list are major distinguishers - I care vastly more about past internship experience, examples of code you've shipped, and your GitHub profile than anything you listed.

No one wants to work with a person that defaults to assuming other people must be the problem.
