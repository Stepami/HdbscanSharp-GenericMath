/u/TheBigEgg23 on Who could bench press the most in the league currently (1 rep)
Idk if he's technically in the league anymore but my bet is either Pekovic or someone jacked with shorter arms. Pekovic just looks like a strong fucking dude, but a short-armed guy has a clear advantage. Blake's arms are short comparatively to his body but I still think they're too long.
