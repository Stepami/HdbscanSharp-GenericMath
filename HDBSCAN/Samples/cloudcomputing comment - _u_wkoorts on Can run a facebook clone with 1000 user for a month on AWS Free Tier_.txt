/u/wkoorts on Can run a facebook clone with 1000 user for a month on AWS Free Tier?
There's not nearly enough information here to be able to answer that I'm afraid. The biggest question right off the bat would be what exactly do you mean by 1000 users? How they use it, when they use it, what kinds of things they use it for, what exactly the platform supports, how it supports them, what caching is used are all just a few of the questions that have to be asked. As an example, if you have 1000 users signed up to your platform but they all only use it every other day, and they only use it to load a heavily-cached simple feed of information that barely changes then sure, you may be able to fit into the free usage tier. If you have 1000 users who use it as much as people use Facebook, for all the same functionality that Facebook has, including the likes of ad services and god-only-knows-what-else in the form of logging and tracking in the background then you could blow it out in a day. So there's just not enough info to answer this I'm afraid.
