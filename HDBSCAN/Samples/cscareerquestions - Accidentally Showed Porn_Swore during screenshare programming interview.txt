Accidentally Showed Porn/Swore during screenshare programming interview
Throwaway for obvious reasons. During a two hour long test, I accidentally opened up a folder of porn/had porn chrome browser suggestions during the interview. I was able to get a working solution though. Also managed to say fuck because I didn't mute my mic. I'm guessing I fucked up and won't move on? Thoughts? In a side note, this whole screensharing interview thing is pretty stupid, I have never done this in years of interviewing (either phone/shared text editor always...)  submitted by /u/interviewpornthrow [link] [comments]
