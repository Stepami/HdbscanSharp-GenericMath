/u/dan1son on How do you find cool places to work at? (Not Big N)
That's illegal. "Culture fit" can not include protected classes. This really only applies to the people doing the hiring, or the employee once they're employed. But if someone I was interviewing asked me the age of the people on the team that would be a huge red flag, and I wouldn't answer the question. I would instead inform them about the age discrimination laws.
