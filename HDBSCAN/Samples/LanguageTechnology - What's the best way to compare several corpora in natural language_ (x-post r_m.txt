What's the best way to compare several corpora in natural language? (x-post r/machinelearning)
Hi everyone, I've been doing LDA topic models of narrative reports in natural language for a research project. I have several smallish corpora (from 1400 to 200 docs each â€“ I know, that's tiny!) that I'd like to compare, but I don't know how to do that beyond looking at each LDA model (for instance with pyLDAviz). My academic background is not in CS, and I'm still a bit new to NLP. What are some good ways to compare topics across corpora/topic models? For instance, is it possible to estimate how much two LDA models overlap? Or are there other ways to assess the topic similarity of several corpora? Thanks in advance for your help!  submitted by /u/oxfordphdstudent [link] [comments]
