Is it better to go to a University or a University of a applied sciences (HBO) for a comp science degree?
I'm curious what's the difference. An HBO looks kind of more appealing because you get some hands on experience, but I feel like theres some drawback to it so I'm curious what you guys think  submitted by /u/JustWowMane [link] [comments]
