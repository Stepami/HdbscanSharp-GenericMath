[Windhorst] The NBA will never re seed the playoffs based on 16 best teams because NBA doesnt want more smaller markets from the West
From The Jump show. Basically since there are more smaller markets in the West with better teams than most of the big market East teams, the NBA doesnt want them to dominate in the playoffs. Also said to have a rule change they need 20 votes, and obviously most if not all teams in the East would never want this.  submitted by /u/24KobeGoat [link] [comments]
