/u/abol3z on Beautiful soup? justtext? dragnet? Not super happy with any of these. Maybe I'm using them wrong? Advice on the best way to reliably pull text from a large number of varied websites. Beginner ooking for advice from the veteran data miners.
I am using two different libs for parsing articles, and they both are correctly handling more than 90% of the articles I'm getting (60+ sources, and some are really bad websites). The first one is newspaper. It's a python project for parsing articles, although i am using the article parser party only. Second, Snacktory Java lib, it combines beautiful soup, and readibility, and it is giving me really good results. Its only problem is that it breaks the article formating (line breaks and paragraph breaks).
