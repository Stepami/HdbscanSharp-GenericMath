/u/pie-oh on Robert E. Lee descendant says he quit as pastor after flock objects to praising Black Lives Matter
https://twitter.com/forstudentpower/status/902889771927785473 It's almost as if disruption makes people uncomfortable, and actually talk about the issue. Because people have been protesting this for absolutely ages and no one has taken notice. It is in huge part because of BLM that people have taken notice. Also, I'm against reperations which was pushed as being part of the black lives matters platform.  You are against the idea that because a group of people have profited in slavery from others â€” and all of us who are white have profited from that (even still), that they're not entitled to those people helping pay to the families that should have had the money in the first place, and helping fix the poverty that they've put on them. People were forced from their homes, their countries. They were made to work for free. They were beaten, raped, and hurt. When they were freed they had absolutely nothing, except fear of being lynched. Meanwhile, people who profited from the free work that their slaves did passed that money down to their ancestors. Their descendants went to better schools because they could afford it.
