/u/CyberByte on Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks debunks AI hype seven ways
This seems to be a slightly stripped down version of debunking attempt that he posted on his blog last month. I posted my thoughts on that on the related discussions on /r/slatestarcodex (and also in a much smaller thread on /r/ControlProblem). First two paragraphs that summarize my view on this: I think many of the things Brooks mentions here are true, in the sense that they are (mostly) real misconceptions that some people have. They are essentially a list of bad reasons to fear AI. The problem is that just because there are bad reasons for something, it doesn't mean that there aren't also good reasons. As is usual for AI risk "skeptics" Brooks does not seem very familiar with the arguments that his fellow scientists have formulated (otherwise he'd probably not be a skeptic). In some cases, he seems to have heard of them, but instead of delving deeper to actually understand them, he prefers to just call them ridiculous (read: non-obvious) or pattern-match some misconception to them.
