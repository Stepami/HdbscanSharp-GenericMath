/u/NotExecutable on Javascript : The Curious Case of Null >= 0
Just to clarify, I don't think that the "NaN" is good design. There is no reason why[1] Math.sqrt(-1), Infinity - Infinity and Math.log(-1) should all have the same return value. But if they DO have the same return-value, I think it causes more problems if that value is equal to itself. e.g. having a separate operator for floating point equality that differs from normal identity equality;  The IEEE-754 spec was published in 1985. Did languages back then already distinguish between equality and identity? I kind of like the idea of something like this:  double foo = Math.sqrt(-1); double bar = Math.log(-1); print (foo == bar); // true print (foo === bar); // false  Which would probably be a pain to implement in silicon, but could be implemented in a language itself easily (simply by overloading the operators). [1: Except for chip-manufacturing / technological constraints. The IEEE-754 is cheap to implement.]
