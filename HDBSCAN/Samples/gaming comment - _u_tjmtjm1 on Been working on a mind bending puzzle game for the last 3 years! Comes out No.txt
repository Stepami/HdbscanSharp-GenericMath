I honestly see this as a potential tool for teaching geometry. One if the hardest parts is having a student understand it visually, conceptually. I could have someone get all the equations correct, but they couldnt draw what they're writing to save their life. Soatial relationship can be very difficult for some. I'll be looking forward to this. Thank you.
