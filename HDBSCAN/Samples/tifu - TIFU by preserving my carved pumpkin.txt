TIFU by preserving my carved pumpkin
Obligatory "not today, was last Halloween." Just remembered this reading some posts today. As per annual tradition, my family carved pumpkins for last Halloween. I didn't do anything special this year, just some goofy face or something. I remembered that if you rub the inside of the pumpkin with vegetable oil, it helps preserve the pumpkin longer. No sweat! We just bought a big can of Pam. That'd work, right? I spray it liberally inside and used my hand to spread it around. I then placed a few tea lights inside. I lit my trusty grill lighter, moved it into the pumpkin. WHOOSH! Everyone looked up just in time to miss the small pillar of fire erupt, engulfing my arm. The air was filled with the smell of burnt popcorn. My arm, formally pale white and covered in light red hair, was now slightly pink and covered in small globules of melted keratin. TL;DR Don't spray an aerosol vegetable oil in your jack-o-lantern.  submitted by /u/chimusicguy [link] [comments]
