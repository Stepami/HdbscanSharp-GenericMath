/u/Gloire_a_Satan on China's Xi tells Trump that North Korea nuclear issue must be solved via talks
And what of these people if we start a war?  A lot of suffering and deaths in the short term. But how much more suffering, deaths, famines are they going to go through in the future? How much did they already go through in the past decades? It is a very difficult thing to calculate and think about, but the cost of inaction is just as real as the cost of warmongering. I'm not saying I'm pro war and want to see blood being shed right now. I'm just saying that when you think about it, there's certainly some sense behind the idea of getting rid of that evil state. But it's probably too late now that they are a nuclear power. If war had to happen, it should have happened before, not now, not after.
