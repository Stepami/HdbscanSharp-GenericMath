/u/this1 on First 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' Trailer
I think people were made because the color schemed looked more like a sitcom than a movie. Based on the stills. Now that I've seen the trailer I'm feeling much more positive, yes they're fighting in the day, yes some colors are bright, but there's a good mix of both dark and bright in the scenes shown here. It doesn't look as cheesy in this trailer. Bring on the hype.
