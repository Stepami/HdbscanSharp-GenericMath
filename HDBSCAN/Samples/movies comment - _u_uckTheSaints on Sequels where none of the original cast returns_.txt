/u/uckTheSaints on Sequels where none of the original cast returns.
Eh kind of. 10 cloverfield lane was never intended to be a Cloverfield sequel. It was a different project called Valencia or some shit that had been finished and in the can for a year before they decided to give it Cloverfield branding so they could cash in. I mean technically it's a sequel with no returning characters, but the movie wasn't a sequel when it was made
