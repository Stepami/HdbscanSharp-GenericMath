TIFU by ignoring basic safety.
The most dangerous tool in the shed is the one you're most familiar with. It's the one you use almost every day and feel so overconfident with that you completely ignore all safety protocols. We've all done it, no eye protection, no gloves..... and (GASP) no safety guards. Those things are always in the way, right? ;) My angle grinder is such a tool. I use that thing every day on my hobby farm and the guards are long gone. Just a microsecond brush with the grinding wheel causes a spiffy injury which bleeds a bit. I set out to cut off a nail and for my troubles I've got a nice two and a half inch long 1/4 inch wide and 1/8th inch deep groove in my hand. Having some trouble visualizing this? Let me help. Here is a photo. Imgur I'm willing to bet you've removed the safety guard from your angle grinder too. You, like me, probably removed that thing the first day you got it. TL;DR - I got a spiffy wound when the angle grinder bit me. Please wear gloves.  submitted by /u/NCHippy [link] [comments]
