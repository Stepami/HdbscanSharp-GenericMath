[EVERYTHING] Another Jon Snow Theory
I was listening to the Nights Watch Oath during a youtube video and noticed something. Part of the oath goes "I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post". I think this has significance to Jons character because he in fact is doing some of these things. "I shall hold no lands" - He holds Winterfell in the North "I shall wear no crowns" - He is the King in the North "and win no glory" - He is glorified for defeating Ramsey Bolton in the battle of the bastards "I shall live and die at my post" - He lived, was killed, but then lived again I think this has significance because he has yet to take a wife or father any children. I think this will happen in Season 8 with Daenerys and he will have officially done the opposite of everything he swore he wouldnt do. His watch did end after he died though so he is in the clear for me. Edit: I realize he died and the pact no longer is in effect. My point is that now all the things he doing are the things he couldn’t do in the nights watch. Not that it’s bad, just that we can predict more of what Jon will do in the next season.  submitted by /u/iChimChim [link] [comments]
