I love telling horror stories in two sentences so much that I made an anthology series called (you guessed it) TWO SENTENCE HORROR STORIES! AMA!
Hey Reddit, it's Vera here, just your average Sagittarius Rabbit child of Chinese immigrants whose love of public libraries led me to two turning points - reading Stephen King's IT at 12 years old and watching Akira Kurosawa's DREAMS at 15. I also read THE ENTITY and watched I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE way too young, but I'm still here making horror movies! Watch my series TWO SENTENCE HORROR STORIES on go90: http://go90.show/2k016iE Thanks for chatting. Signing off! Proof: https://i.redd.it/mfbgpin463qz.jpg  submitted by /u/vivamiao [link] [comments]
