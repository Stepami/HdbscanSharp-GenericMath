Opportunity scoring/likelyhood to buy. What method should be used?
I am trying to calculate the likelyhood a customer will buy our products. We have a catalog of 50 products, all would have differentu uses and appeals . so widely varied. I know from anecdotal evidence, that customers in rural areas would be unlikely to buy one of our products, customers with more than 10 employees would be unlikely to buy another, and some products naturally go well together. I would like to calculate for every customer , the likelyhood he buys the product, for all 50 products. What would be the best method to be used here? *Propensity scoring? Multinomial regressoin  other?    submitted by /u/br24242 [link] [comments]
