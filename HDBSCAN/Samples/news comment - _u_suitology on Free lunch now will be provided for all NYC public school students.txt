/u/suitology on Free lunch now will be provided for all NYC public school students
I was one of the students that got the free lunch when I was younger. It's not what you are thinking. Half a pbj, milk was required by my state luckily for all lunches, water, few spoonfulls of corn, 3-5 baby carrots.
