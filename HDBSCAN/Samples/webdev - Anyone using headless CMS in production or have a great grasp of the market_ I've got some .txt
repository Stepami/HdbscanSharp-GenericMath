Anyone using headless CMS in production or have a great grasp of the market? I've got some questions.
First of all - what’s the cost of a headless CMS like Contentful? Anyone have a production website with a ballpark figure with traffic and api-calls? How many records is a typical blog post? Any competitors to Contentful I should be considering? I’m thinking both in terms of performance but also, as there is a race for market share now, I’d like to try to commit to one that’s unlikely to go out of business once the market is segmented. I’ll be using it as CMS in a Laravel application to save time and keep the marketing separated from the actual app - any reason this is not a good idea?  submitted by /u/mmeebbee [link] [comments]
