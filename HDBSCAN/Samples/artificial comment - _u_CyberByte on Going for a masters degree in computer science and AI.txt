/u/CyberByte on Going for a masters degree in computer science and AI
Has anyone done this?  I did my master's in AI (not CS) and it was really interesting. Did it help your career in the long term?  I guess it helped be get a job, and then get a PhD position. Obviously I learned a lot in my AI bachelor and master programs and this has informed me throughout my career. However, I can't compare it to getting a master's in CS, because I haven't lived that life. Where I'm from (some place in Europe) and for my level of education, getting a master's degree is pretty much expected though (getting just a bachelor's is kind of weird, and a PhD is mostly for career academics or people wanting international prospects). Did it matter where you went to school?  Not where I'm from, but that's probably not very relevant to you. My understanding is that in the US and UK it matters quite a bit, but catjhill gave a much better answer about that than I ever could. What exactly are you asking? Which option to choose between AI and CS? Whether to do a master's degree at all vs. stop after undergrad vs. get a PhD? I'd say that if you're interested in AI, then study AI and not anything else. If you want a career in this field, I think it's a good idea to get a graduate degree. Whether that can be just a MS or needs to be a PhD depends on where you are and what you want. In the US I get the impression that a PhD is much better, and I think you could always (or sometimes) start a PhD program and get a master's degree a few years into it on the way to the PhD (or you could drop out at that point if you want).
