/u/Trash_Count on Neighbors never knew Macomb couple kept disabled sex slave in shed
The "community" of southern California is keep your eyes on your own business. This is how we like it. This is how we want it. I certainly have no time or desire to entertain the people who decided to live next to me. As a very busy med student, I barely have time to fuck my gf let alone talk to the dude who lives next door.
