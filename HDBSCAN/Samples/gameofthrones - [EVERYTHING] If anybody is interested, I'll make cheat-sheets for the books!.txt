[EVERYTHING] If anybody is interested, I'll make cheat-sheets for the books!
Now that the show is far ahead of the books - but you wanna catch up on the details and can't read 5000 pages, I can make infographic cheat sheets. (see my other posts) -something on those lines, but different/custom artwork etc. All the way from Aegon's Conquest to right now. But I can't guarantee the order of release. I am only asking because I got a few messages asking for more cheat sheets like "Robert's rebellion" (here on the forum) Is there enough interest in this?  submitted by /u/KingInTheNorthish [link] [comments]
