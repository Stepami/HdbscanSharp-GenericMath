/u/prdlph on I am Erwin Chemerinsky, constitutional law scholar and dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. Ask me about free speech on college campuses and more!
Hey dude, just chiming in as someone at Berkeley. The issue isn't that Milo himself might be in danger without funds, it's that everyone around him and therefore people on campus might be in danger. Berkeley has a responsibility to protect their students, and not preparing for a bunch of outside protestors who have been violent in the past would be failing at that responsibility. So they are forced to spend money on security, money which they desperately need for things like financial aid, ensuring that they can offer enough classes, and the other basic things which go into operating a university. And, a lot of this money wasn't even from California to begin with, it was from private donors. If they get to the point where they can't take reasonable steps to ensure student safety because they don't have the money for it, it would be irresponsible to encourage these events. Yea, they can't stop people from doing them in public areas, but they shouldn't be forced to support them with a lecture hall etc. To take this to an extreme, you obviously don't want to let protestors bankrupt and shut down a university, but you also don't want universities to be able to use financial concerns to never allow protest. This is why you have to have better legal guidance in this area than currently exists. E: in case it wasn't clear, the police who come are not California police or the town of berkeleys police. They are specifically the university of California police usually, and are paid for directly by UC Berkeley, not some other govt entity.
