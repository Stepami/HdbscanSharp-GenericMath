Parsing multiple questions contained in one single user query
If a single query from the user contains multiple questions belonging to different categories, how can they be identified, split and parsed? Eg -  User - what is the weather now and tell me my next meeting Parser - {:weather => "what is the weather", :schedule => "tell me my next meeting"}  Parser identifies the parts of sentences where the question belongs to two different categories  User - show me hotels in san francisco for tomorrow that are less than $300 but not less than $200 are pet friendly have a gym and a pool with 3 or 4 stars staying for 2 nights and dont include anything that doesnt have wifi Parser - {:hotels => ["show me hotels in san francisco", "for tomorrow", "less than $300 but not less than $200", "pet friendly have a gym and a pool", "with 3 or 4 stars", "staying for 2 nights", "with wifi"]}  Parser identifies the question belonging to only one category but has additional steps for fine tuning the answer and created an array ordered according to the steps to take From what I can understand this requires a sentence segmenter, multi-label classifier and co-reference resolution But the sentence segementer I have come across depend heavily on grammar, punctuations. Multi-label classifiers, like a good trained naive bayes classifier works in most cases but since they are multi-label, most times output multiple categories for sentences which clearly belong to one class. Depending solely on the array outputs to check the labels present would fail. If used a multi-class classifier, that is also good to check the array output of probable categories but obviously they dont tell the different parts of the sentence much accurately, much less in what fashion to proceed with the next step. As a first step, how can I tune sentence segmenter to correctly split the sentence without any strict grammar rules. Good accuracy of this would help a lot in classification. Please pardon me if this question comes across naive. It would be helpful if you could point out where to be correct.
