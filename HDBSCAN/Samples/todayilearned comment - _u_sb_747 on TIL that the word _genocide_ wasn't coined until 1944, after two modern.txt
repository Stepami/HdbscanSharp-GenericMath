/u/sb_747 on TIL that the word "genocide" wasn't coined until 1944, after two modern genocides had already taken place: first the Armenian Genocide and then The Holocaust. Until then "crimes against humanity" or "massacre" was used to describe genocide.
Except for the fact that no material evidence has ever been presented that the goal of the Turks was to actually kill the Armenians rather than indifference to their wellbeing during a forced relocation. Not denying that the Turks engaged in ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity but genocide has a very specific definition that requires the death of a specific group be a specific goal of the actions taken and that has never been established
