Hey Q, I once heard that during your time in Paris that Picasso paid for a meal you had together at a restaurant with his leftovers instead of money. Can you confirm this? More importantly, from Picasso or any of the other great 20th century artists you've known or worked with, is there anything you learned or observed from them which may have helped you with your own life and/or career that you can pass on to us. Thanks in advance and God bless.
