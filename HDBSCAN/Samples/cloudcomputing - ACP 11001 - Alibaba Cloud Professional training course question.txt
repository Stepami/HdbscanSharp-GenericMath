ACP 11001 - Alibaba Cloud Professional training course question
Has anyone looked at or completed the Alibaba Cloud courses (or trainings)? Source: https://www.alibabacloud.com/support/training?spm=a3c0i.122563.616342.1.6c6b6ad1CSkGtS Furthermore, are they capable of becoming a large player in the cloud field? Or better to look at the better known brands for now? Thanks r/cloudcomputing  submitted by /u/sightseekr [link] [comments]
