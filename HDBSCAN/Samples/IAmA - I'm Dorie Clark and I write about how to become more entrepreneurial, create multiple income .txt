I'm Dorie Clark and I write about how to become more entrepreneurial, create multiple income streams, and basically build a badass career. AMA!
I'm an author and entrepreneur with some cool past jobs and side gigs (presidential campaign spokesperson, award-winning journalist, a producer of a multiple Grammy-winning jazz album). My new book is Entrepreneurial You and Inc. magazine called my last one, Stand Out, "the best leadership book of 2015" and Forbes named it one of the top 10 of the year. The New York Times was kind enough to call me "an expert at self-reinvention and helping others make changes in their lives." Ask me anything!
