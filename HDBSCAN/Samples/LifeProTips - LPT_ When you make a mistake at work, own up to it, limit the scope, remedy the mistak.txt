LPT: When you make a mistake at work, own up to it, limit the scope, remedy the mistake, explain how you will avoid the same mistake in the future.
1) Own up to it. Obviously, this is a tough one to do. It's easy to pass blame onto someone or something else, but admitting you made the mistake shows honesty and responsibility. 2) Limit the scope. When a mistake is find, people are going to assume the worst, that everything was done incorrectly, so limit the scope of mistake and explain it's just X that's wrong, not X-Y-Z. 3) Remedy the mistake. Fix it. Correct the wrong. Find a way to get this done, this is the most important step. 4) Explain how you will avoid this mistake in the future. Maybe it's adding some checks and balances, maybe it's an adjustment of the process, but it's always reassuring to describe the new measures in which this mistake will be avoided.  submitted by /u/titanrunner2 [link] [comments]
