HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHA, what a clown. It's time to calm down mate and stop misinterpreting my words and to stop going full SJW. When did I say nobody goes through hardship today? Just because life was mostly harder 100 years ago doesn't mean it isn't hard today. I don't even watch that much TV and what I do watch of it is sports. I never said we should be proud of racism and misogyny in past generations? Stop putting words on my mouth You went full retard in that comment, never go full retard
