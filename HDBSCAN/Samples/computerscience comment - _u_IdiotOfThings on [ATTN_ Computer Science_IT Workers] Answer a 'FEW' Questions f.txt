/u/IdiotOfThings on [ATTN: Computer Science/IT Workers] Answer a 'FEW' Questions for my Research?
I'm not an engineer. Nothing motivated me. No. Inside a room in a building with a desk. Can you repeat that? Fucking Google if you can't solve something. Hard and easy ones. A likeable one. I don't want to be sitting with some lame ass all day asking me questions like what internships have I had or if computer engineering is important to society. I would die. None.
