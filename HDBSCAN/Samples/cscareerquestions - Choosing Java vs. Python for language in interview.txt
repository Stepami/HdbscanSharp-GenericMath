Choosing Java vs. Python for language in interview
The following is based on my knowledge/skills/comfort (or lack thereof) as opposed to INHERENT qualities of the languages. Why Python? It's more pseudocode-like than Java. Easier to just start coding without having to "set things up." Don't have to worry about specifying Type/Class for anything in the code. The Python dictionary is a VERY, VERY useful weapon. Why not Python? I don't know how to do OOP in Python. Don't know how to implement trees and linked lists in Python. Why Java? I do know how to implement trees using this language. I do know how to implement linked lists using this language. Why not Java? Clunkier, more overhead to set things up in the code, I have never used a HashMap in my life (compare that to my knowing how to use the powerful Python dictionary). For now: Java for trees/linkedList problems, Python for string processing and graph problems (adjacency list is what I use) and anything needing a hash. What if it's a tree problem that also needs a hash? Well, then need to figure out which language has the holes that are easiest to patch up for me.
