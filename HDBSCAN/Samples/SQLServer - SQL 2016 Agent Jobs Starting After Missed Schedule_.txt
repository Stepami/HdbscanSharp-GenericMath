SQL 2016 Agent Jobs Starting After Missed Schedule?
Hi All, So we are just starting to get acquainted with SQL 2016, and we used dbatoools (kick ass stuff) to copy over pretty much everything. We are currently looking at agent jobs.... specifically scheduled SSIS packages. Now, I haven't really been able to dive into this yet, but it appears that these jobs kicked off on the new 2016 server even though they were scheduled to run in the past. Does the 2016 agent behave this way... like - oh I missed some schedules - lets kick off jobs now to catch up! I will RTFM, but figured I would ask here also; Thanks!!  submitted by /u/MrHoosFoos [link] [comments]
