/u/loondawg on Domestic Violence Murder Rates Drop In States With Stricter Gun Laws, Study Finds
We agree a link to the study would have been better than a link to the article. But I did not read the article and think they were trying to imply all guns laws result in reduced violence. Far from that. It appeared to me they were being specific about one particular circumstance where stricter laws made a difference while pointing out some other areas where it didn't. I think you're jumping the gun in attributing dastardly motives to someone based on what you think was implied. Discussing the specific claims of the article is far more productive than making accusations about perceived motives.
