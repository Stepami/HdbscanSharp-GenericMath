/u/shadowmint on Secure a Web Api in ASP.NET Core
JWT is the new 'web scale'. Everyone says to use it, and it seems sometimes like no one actually understands why. I've literally had this conversation maybe 4 or 5 times in the last 2 weeks: blog, person, whatever: 'This is how to use JWT and manage tokens... ' me: 'Why?' them: '...because mobile and SPA and... JWT... is good... right?' me: 'Why?' them: '...? Cookies are bad' me: 'Why? Everyone uses cookies. They're robust proven technology. They do exactly the same thing as JWT. Why are you using JWT? You're manually re-implementing the browser cookie store. Why?' them: '....' me: 'Well, I don't think you should be using JWT because there are downsides to doing that stuff yourself if you don't have a good reason.'
