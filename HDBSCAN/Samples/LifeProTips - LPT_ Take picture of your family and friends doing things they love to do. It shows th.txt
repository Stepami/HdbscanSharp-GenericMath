LPT: Take picture of your family and friends doing things they love to do. It shows them in their environment and isn't just a group shot.
I started doing this about 2 years ago, hunting, working on cars or drawing they are my favorite photos of my family and friends.  submitted by /u/xPlatypusVenom [link] [comments]
