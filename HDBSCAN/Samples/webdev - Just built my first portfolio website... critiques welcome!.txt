Just built my first portfolio website... critiques welcome!
I'm fresh out of a 7 month front-end coding 'bootcamp' and just finished up my first portfolio site. https://dstock48.github.io/portfolio/ Please let me know if anything looks off or if there is anything I could be doing better!  submitted by /u/dhw2 [link] [comments]
