/u/Demtrollzz on Former H2K Managerâ€™s letter to Riot, players, and EU teams: "I feel your pain, but your brands and branding activities are poor. Most of you exist as a logo on a social media page and on the LCS screens the day you play."
That's my point though: The NA teams are not doing anything with it...people just happen to love 1 or more guys on the team and that's pretty much it. If that's not true to the same extent for other teams, they can't really be blamed for that. Yamato for instance has always been a very controversial guy. Also he's a coach, same as Pr0lly, and coaches naturally don't attract as many fans as players. And why should people become NiP fans just because they used to be good at CSGO a long time ago? It would be a different story if these NA teams visibly did a great job at marketing these personalities - but they don't, unless i'm really missing something.
