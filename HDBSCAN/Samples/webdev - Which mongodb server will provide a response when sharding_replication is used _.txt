Which mongodb server will provide a response when sharding/replication is used ?
I'm aiming to host 3 mongos (mongo shard) instances in 3 different servers in EU, US and CHINA (config server, replication & shards included). Assuming we have 3 shards with regional replications, each one has a regional tag (EU, US, CHINA) alongside the collections. If a CHINESE user requests the chinese server, does china-hosted mongo needs to make blocking read/write queries with other shards ? ( with replication/sharding, each server has the full content of the DB) NB : I haven't found a cloud solution to host my DB due to latency problems, which is my biggest concern.  submitted by /u/CipheredBytes [link] [comments]
