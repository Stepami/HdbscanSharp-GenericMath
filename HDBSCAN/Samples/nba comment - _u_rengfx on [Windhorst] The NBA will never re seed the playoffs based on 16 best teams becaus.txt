/u/rengfx on [Windhorst] The NBA will never re seed the playoffs based on 16 best teams because NBA doesnt want more smaller markets from the West
This doesn't really make all that much sense, as a 4 game blowout with bad east teams vs elite east teams in the 1st and 2nd round in no way corresponds to SO MUCH of a rating increase to justify not changing it There would be significantly better ratings of a good west team playing an elite east team in the first round if the format was changed With players being more in control of where then end up both in free agency lately and by forcing trades, this will eventually equalize and don't we all want to see the best basketball possible?
