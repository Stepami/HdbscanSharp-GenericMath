File System Corruption in AWS Storage Gateway Volume
Has anyone had to deal with a corrupt file system on a storage gateway volume? One of my volumes is now telling me that it's corrupted or unreadable. I've tried running a chkdsk /r on it and it took days (10TB volume). Once completed I got the same error message. I didn't have snapshotting scheduled so I don't have a previous version of these files. I'm currently working with AWS support and they're having me run chkdsk a couple of different ways. Has anyone had to deal with this before? PS: BTW, don't run a chkdsk on a storage gateway volume, it screws up your cache and runs very slowly  submitted by /u/Blsub6 [link] [comments]
