Newbie question: What classification to use in this case?
Here is data (vertical and horizontal speeds of people while skydiving) plotted: https://imgur.com/a/V6JPl I'm developing web app for analysis and I want to automatically split gps track on segments. Classes are: 1 - On the ground 2 - Under parachute 3 - In aircraft 4 - In free fall  I've been trying to find algorithm for unsupervised learning and come to decision to use supervised learning so I'll classify training data to these classes manually. Each track consists of 1000-5000 points and my first vision was to iterate through track points and search for class based on training data, then use median filter, like if most of points in a window belongs to one class - select class. I was thinking to use kNN classifier but I worry about performance issues - if I search 5000 times using kNN based on 10k points of training data - it may take a lot of time (I think). Could you please recommend me direction and useful links? EDIT: After asking question I found this paper which describe study on gps data segmentation.
