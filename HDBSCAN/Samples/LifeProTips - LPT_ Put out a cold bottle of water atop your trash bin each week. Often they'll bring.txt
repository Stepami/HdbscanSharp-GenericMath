LPT: Put out a cold bottle of water atop your trash bin each week. Often they'll bring the bins back up to where you keep them, but more likely they'll look the other way when it comes to extra trash
Learned this from our old neighbor before he moved. Put a water bottle atop the trash and the workers who have to take it appreciate it, especially in warmer months. In our case they bring the bins back up to the garage, but the real benefit is that they'll take extra trash when it's out. Just one or two extra bags and you break even. And in the meantime, you're helping out your sanitation workers.  submitted by /u/BedWedOrBehead [link] [comments]
