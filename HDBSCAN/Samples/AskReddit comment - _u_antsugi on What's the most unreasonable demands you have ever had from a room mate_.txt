/u/antsugi on What's the most unreasonable demands you have ever had from a room mate?
I guess mainly it's because I'm looking at it from a "my roommate" perspective rather than a disgruntled third party. That, and if someone there that lives with the noisy guy calls the cops, the cops will probably show up and be pissed pretty fast since the guy just wanted to be let inside his apartment and you decided to call police instead
