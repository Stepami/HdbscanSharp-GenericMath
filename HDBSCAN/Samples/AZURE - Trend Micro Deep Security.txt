Trend Micro Deep Security
Anybody have experience with implementing Trend Micro's Deep Security in Azure? Looking to place more security around our ecommerce platform which includes roughly 12 VMs along with other resources. Either I can implement various platforms and tools such as endpoint AV, IPS/IDS, SIEM, etc. or I can go with Trend Micro's "native" support. Feedback either way with experience?  submitted by /u/knawlejj [link] [comments]
