/u/mgw854 on Does anyone care about .NET Standard 1.x?
I've written quite a few libraries at work now, all targeting some version of .NET Standard 1.x. While I'll agree that 1.0 wasn't terribly useful, I've flexed quite a bit of programming muscle in 1.5. There's no reason to go to 2.0 if your code works absolutely fine in 1.x. Now, if you need some functionality that's only available in 2.0, go for it. As much as I love to be on the bleeding edge at home, constantly updating everything at work just to use some cool new package because the developer decided to use the latest version isn't feasible.
