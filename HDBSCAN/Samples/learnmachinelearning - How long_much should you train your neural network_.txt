How long/much should you train your neural network?
Hello I use 10k iterations to train my neural network using backpropagation. Now depending on my trainingdata it happens that training makes my the value of my loss function increase rather than decrease after a certain time. What happened:  iteration 1 untill 4300: 11.6 decreases to 0.57253 iteration 4300 untill 10k: 0.57253 increases to 0.57719  Why does my loss function suddenly increase? How can I find the optimal number of training iterations so that I don't have this increase?  submitted by /u/the3liquid [link] [comments]
