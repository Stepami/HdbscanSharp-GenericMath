/u/Textipulator on LPT: When you sign a lease, get a copy immediately, and take a picture of it and store it in an email to yourself to insure you have a copy of it.
When you send that email to yourself, include several pictures of the issues or damage that you may have found in the house (must be within a few days of move in to be taken seriously) that way if they try to blame it on you, you have proof that it was there upon move in.
