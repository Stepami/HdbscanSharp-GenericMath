/u/peanutbuttersucks on Thursday Night Football gets strong rating on CBS, NFL Network
Disappointed?!? It had: 2 Turnovers, and a few near miss interceptions More than a few clutch pass breakups Sweet DJax sideline toe tap catch A weird TD by Hogan Several punts downed inside the 10 A 40+ yard punt return An 85 yard FG drive Back-to-back Roughing the passer penalties before halftime to get them in FG range Both QBs threw for over 300 yards Kicker drama An attempted onside kick And the game mattered all the way to the last play. I'm not sure what you wanted? High scoring does not mean good game, and low scoring does not mean bad game. Yeah it was sloppy at times, but that's football in week 5, especially on a Thursday. I personally enjoyed the hell outta the game.
