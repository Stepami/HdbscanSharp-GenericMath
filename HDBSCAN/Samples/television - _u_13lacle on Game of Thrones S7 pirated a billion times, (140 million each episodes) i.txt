Or it is fundamentally different. There is no rivalry component, which is really the only reason for property laws to exist. Meaning one consumers consumption prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers or the consumption by one party reduces the utility/ability to use to another. Also there is near zero marginal cost to providing it to another person. Also even though they are trying their best to make the information(tv shows in this case) excludable (adding DRM etc) information with any type of access is pretty much non-exludable by default. These two properties mean it should be open-access property ie not owned by anyone. Intellectual property rights should at best be a limited monopoly to recover development costs to level the playing field and not anywhere near what it is now. In it's current state it actively goes against its purpose of promoting the progress of science and useful arts. Some easy to visualize examples are an apple, a hammer, and a song. If I eat an apple, you can no longer use it and thus can't be fully shared. If I am using a hammer, you can't use it while I am using it but can be shared over time. If I think of a song and play it and you want to play it too there is nothing preventing you from using it while I am using it and therefore does not cause me any harm.
