[EVERYTHING] Who won the debate?
I'm talking about the famous "Knowledge vs Power" debate they had in season 2. For context, Littlefinger basically threatened Cersei with her secret about incest after she showed him that she had done research about him, followed by "knowledge is power". Cersei simply had her men apprehend him and told him that "power is power", then just let him go and left. While on the cards Petyr was right and knowledge should allow you to eventually get power, the show has actually proven Cersei right on this one. Ramsay played smarter than Jon in the Battle of the Bastards but Jon had a large army march to his aid, so he (& Sansa) won.  Cersei had less intellect and knowledge that the Sparrows and Margaery, but she had firepower (literally) so she won.  Dany is often outsmarted and/or imprisoned by her enemies, but being fireproof + having dragons always works to her benefit.  And of course Littlefinger himself is a fine example. He had all the knowledge, but it couldn't hold a candle to some enhanced teenagers with magical skills (and Sansa I guess, she gave the order after all).  All 3 main characters who are in a position of power have no particular knowledge while the characters holding all the knowledge and/or wisdom (Varys, Melissandre, Bran etc) don't really have any real power on their hands.   Or maybe the answer's somewhere in the middle and you need a combination of both. After all Dany had Missandei, Davos, Tyrion and Jorah, Cersei had Qyburn and Jon had Sam and Aemon to get the best of both. Thoughts?  submitted by /u/All_this_hype [link] [comments]
