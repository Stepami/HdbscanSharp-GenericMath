Huge log file on db that was change to Simple Recocery Model.
Hey guys, I feel like this is a dumb question, but I had a database that was created (sql server 2016)...with the plan of it being in the Simple Recovery Model. Low and behold...the server it was created on defaulted to Full Recovery Model. When I noticed, I changed it to simple...but not before the log grew to like 50gb. What's the best practice in this situation after changing it to simple recovery model? Do I just go into the log and change the size in the properties?  submitted by /u/LeonardoDaVincio [link] [comments]
