/u/themooseexperience on Will being a bodybuilder affect my interviews negatively?(serious)
I'd say your punctuation will affect things negatively if anything. All jokes aside, it will not affect it at all. Been bodybuilding for just 2 years now but am pretty big I like to think - and in the interview process with Microsoft and Bloomberg!
