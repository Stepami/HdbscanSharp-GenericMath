How do you balance learning and productivity?
I am a few months into my first job out of college and one thing I am struggling with is balancing completing tasks quickly and gaining deep understanding of the things I touch. I realize that the better I understand a concept now, the more productive I will be in the future when I have to revisit or reuse the concept. However, taking time to delve into a concept hurts my productivity in the here and now. So what I am asking is how should I prioritize learning? Rephrased from a game theory point of view, what should my discount rate on future productivity be when taking into consideration current rewards? Related question: what are the best ways to truly understand concepts you encounter? Do you all take notes, make flash cards, draw diagrams, etc?  submitted by /u/dcprogrammer [link] [comments]
