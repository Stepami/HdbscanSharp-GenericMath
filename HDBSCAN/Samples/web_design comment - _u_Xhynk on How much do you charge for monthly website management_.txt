/u/Xhynk on How much do you charge for monthly website management?
We charge about $100 a month. It's part management, part "retainer". We provide a few things with that: Security Updates SSL cert (easier now with Let's Encrypt/AutoSSL) Hosting, and depending on the structure, Domain Registration 30-60 min of content updates per month (doesn't roll over) Server level email accounts (we don't support email clients like Outlook or their new iPhone, we just make sure email gets to and from the server, email clients/devices are the client's/client's IT responsibility) Transactional Email Sending through Mandrill Effectively unlimited storage and bandwidth, some exceptions (personally I'd bill in tiers for both, but I'm a code monkey, not a price setter). Tech support for errors/downtime/database errors/etc Generalized support and basic marketing assistance
