Help with setting up local web environment (code 208)
What am I doing wrong? Hi. I am trying to create a local testing environment using IIS, PHP 5.3 (couldn't get 7 to work), and SQL Server 2012. This is my first time using these tools for web dev. I finally was able to find a set of credentials that worked to make the sql_srv connect function work (I am a LAMP guy), but then I get this error: ERROR RUNNING SQL STATEMENT CODE: 208 MESSAGE: [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'dbo.tblArticle'. QUERY: SELECT ART_ID, ART_Path FROM dbo.tblArticle servername = "(local)" login = "sa" password = "password" dbname = ""  The thing is, there is no 'dbo.tblArticle' table in my database. I don't know what to do.  submitted by /u/roncru [link] [comments]
