TIFU by adding new mods! Everyone give a nice warm booing to the following people
Hey everyone! Earlier this month we opened mod applications, and after a fierce Hunger-games style trials, we're excited to introduce the following newest members of the /r/tifu mod team: /u/Cwenham /u/Phornicaite /u/hash_bang22 /u/Bobcobble /u/bobby_thellere /u/guacamolefanatic /u/billyup /u/Sensiblemadness /u/Xathaos /u/Cortesm1 /u/Conalfisher They'll be going through training for the next month, and some of them are brand new to this, so let's go easy on them and not post TIFUs that are too gross, okay? We don't want to scare them away (however, feel free to boo them as much as you want) Thanks to all of those who applied, and if you weren't selected, sorry =(. We're a large sub (over 12 thousand subscribers!) and unfortunately we can't accept everyone who applies. Have a great day everyone!  submitted by /u/Llim [link] [comments]
