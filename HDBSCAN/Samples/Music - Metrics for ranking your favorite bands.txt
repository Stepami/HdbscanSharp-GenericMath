Metrics for ranking your favorite bands
I like a lot of music. I wanted a somewhat objective way to see who is actually my favorite artist. I built a spreadsheet and came up with these categories (below) to grade each artist on. The ranking for each category is 1-5. Right now I have quite a few ties, so I'm looking for some more metrics to throw in, any suggestions? Nostalgia Factor - does the artist bring back memories? Musical Creativity - how original (for their time) was their sound? Overall Strength of Catalog - Do they have a lot of albums, but a lot are duds? Sonic Evolution - Did their sound change and mature/evolve with time? Size of band - This is just for fun, the literal size of the band. Repeat Listening Frequency - How often do I actually listen to them?   submitted by /u/miamivt [link] [comments]
