Asking for a raise one year in
So, I've been in this job for over a year now, there is no formal review process for promotions or raises, just occasional 1 to 1 ones with a technical manager. I feel I've been meeting expectations. I got up to speed, started tackling things autonomously even in unfamiliar areas and now I'm pretty much driving a somewhat important project, so I shouldn't be that expendable, especially when we're having significant trouble filling spots when losing team members. Would raising the subject of a raise put me in a bad spot, if my manager thought I wasn't due for one? If not, how should I go about bringing it up without looking bad?  submitted by /u/antaetipots [link] [comments]
