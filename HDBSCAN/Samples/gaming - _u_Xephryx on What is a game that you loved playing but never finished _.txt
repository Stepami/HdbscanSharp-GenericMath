/u/Xephryx on What is a game that you loved playing but never finished ?
It took me far too long to finally beat FF X. I finally beat it about a year ago after losing two save files that were close to the end. The first save my step dad accidentally saved over. The second one got lost in a move and the memory card was found crushed. It wasn't until the HD remake that I finally beat Sin. Apparently on the second file I was literally at the last boss. My friend told me I had the fight I was at then one more fight. After finding that out I swore to never playboy again because I'd probably get heartbroken again with a corrupted save or broken memory card. But I finally did it. And I cried you guys, I cried hard. My brother who had very little understanding of the story cried with me and we held each other. We hated that we loved the feels the game gave us.
