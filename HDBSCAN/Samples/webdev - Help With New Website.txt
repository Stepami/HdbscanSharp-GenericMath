Help With New Website
Hey folks, Long story short, I need a few tips on how to launch a website. I'm not too tech savy, but I went through namecheap for domain registration and Siteground for hosting. The best I can do was use siteground's web builder and build a coming soon page. I tried using Joomla CMS and ended up learning nothing besides that a webdesigner/developer is essentially a regulated hackerman. The idea: an item listing website that includes yelp-like business establishment listings. Essentially a miniaturized ebay. There will be transaction fees and registration fees. Now that you know my situation, here are my questions: - Where should I be hosting a project of this scale? - Should I outsource the webdesign and accelerate my entry into the market or should I chill and learn the craft? (it does not look easy) - Assuming I would like to tackle this myself, what is a good way to design the site? CMS or ready to use website builders as far as depth in design goes? - Currently using Joomla and leaning towards learning some wordpress, is this wise or just a waste of time?  submitted by /u/az_is [link] [comments]
