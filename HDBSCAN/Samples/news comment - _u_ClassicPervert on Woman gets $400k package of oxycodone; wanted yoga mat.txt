/u/ClassicPervert on Woman gets $400k package of oxycodone; wanted yoga mat
The media's war with Trump isn't a reason to like him - he sorta brought that on himself with the constant Obama birth cert thing.  It's not about that, it's about the greater implication which was "the people have to do as we, the media, say, or else the people are idiots" that really shone through. And he was there to stand in the face of their attacks, which, regardless of who it is, is something I admire in a person. The fact that you have to -- at least in my case -- be secretive and cushioned about your support for a western world nationalist is insane to me. Someone can openly say shit about "white people" with less fear than the inverse, which is also crazy to me and goes against my identity, as well as my political liberalism. The reply to my post earlier that went "trump is scum, if you have any sympathy for him, you're scum" is a residual example of the media war we're talking about.
