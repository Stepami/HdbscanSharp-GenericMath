/u/GreyWolf1945 on TIFU with airport security
The ass thing is mostly a joke but if they are looking for drugs they will shove their hand in multiple different cavities. TSA agents randomly choose people themselves. At least they did when I've gone through. I've also read countless nightmares of people. Especially with baby formula. I also had a friend who had a knife accidentally in his bag. We were on a boy scout trip so someone probably dropped it in but it was not his. Plus everyone in boy scouts know about check bags. He had to explain to them for a minute straight that it was not his and that he did not want it. The system has too much human involvement and is way too broken. So much time is wasted because of simple mistakes or an agent having a bad day
