Speculate: IF Microsoft announced Surface Mobile / Surface Phone this year, WHEN would they do it?
Is there an event remaining this calendar year? Maybe they could announce something when the Fall Creators Update gets released? Maybe they have an all new event for an all new device? It's a pipe dream, but it's fun to dream.  submitted by /u/NuAngel [link] [comments]
