/u/c_o_r_b_a on [EVERYTHING] The Irony for Ser Alliser Thorne
I'm not sure, but I would agree with that poster that it's one of the core themes. The mythology and events of the story are cyclical to demonstrate the futility of war, monarchy, nobility, etc. He's mentioned in interviews that he's personally very anti-war. Also, from watching the show, it's not hard to see the cynicism scattered throughout it. For example, Robert's Rebellion and the War of the Seven Kings starting due to a lie. I don't think it'd be fair to say it's the single point, though.
