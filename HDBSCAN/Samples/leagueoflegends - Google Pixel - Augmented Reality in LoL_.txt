Google Pixel - Augmented Reality in LoL.
Just shown on the Google live stream! Augmented Reality will now be used to enhance the viewing experience for LoL esports! This is Huge. Oddshot of the video they showed - https://oddshot.tv/s/yHdGUf Credit to u/UnfunMid for the oddshot! Edit - Fixed the oddshot link! Also, "This is huge" is in terms of the opportunities this opens up. AR can do big things to enrich our viewing experience in esports.  submitted by /u/Fryzer- [link] [comments]
