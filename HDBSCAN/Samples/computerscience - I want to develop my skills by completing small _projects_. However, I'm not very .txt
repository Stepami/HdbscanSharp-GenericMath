I want to develop my skills by completing small "projects". However, I'm not very creative at ideas. Are there any resources online which can give me small projects to complete?
Hi, I have just completed my first year in a CS degree. I've enjoyed it but I don't have much experience compared to my peers. I want to change that but I find it hard to learn languages etc, unless I have some work "allocated" to me. I thought maybe I could take on a few projects (nothing too big, something that takes roughly a week to complete). However, I can't think of any projects. Everything seems complicated. Does anyone know of any resources online which suggest project ideas for you to create, and then perhaps goes through the implementation? It doesn't need to be language specific (I've learnt a bit of python and java if that helps, and will be learning C++ next year). More project based where I'll have to be thinking of ideas on how to implement it too. Thank you!  submitted by /u/assassinsweed1 [link] [comments]
