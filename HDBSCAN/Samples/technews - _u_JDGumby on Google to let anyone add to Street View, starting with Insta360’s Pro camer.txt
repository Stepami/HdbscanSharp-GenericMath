/u/JDGumby on Google to let anyone add to Street View, starting with Insta360â€™s Pro camera
Ugh. It's already hard enough to get into actual street views in some places without being redirected to nearby user contributions if you haven't zoomed into the road so closely that it fills most of the screen. :/ (edit: and it's even more frequent when you get bored and close your eyes and randomly place the pegman as a form of virtual tourism; yeah, I have no life :P)
