/u/abbbbbba on Rebuild past version of table with CDC data (noob)
So CDC picks up on the changes to the table. It also has a window it stores data for otherwise you are kind of keeping another copy of the log - so maybe 5, 10 or 30 days of history is kept (you configure it). Also its just the changes since you turned it on. This means that if a table already existed before turning on CDC or things have been going on beyond the retention window you can't get a full play back. CDC is good for data warehousing - you can do incremental loads and just nab the records that have changed. Or you can search through the CDC table if you know a record changed and find the old + new value for when a user swears they never touched record X, but 2 days ago there was an update on it. As to a backwards playback, its not something I've ever looked into so can't help there, sorry.
