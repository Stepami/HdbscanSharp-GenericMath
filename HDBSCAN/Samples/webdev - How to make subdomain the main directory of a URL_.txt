How to make subdomain the main directory of a URL?
What I'm trying to accomplish probably has a name, but I'm very unfamiliar with this... maybe masking? I have a web app that currently works out of the directory: https://mydomain.com/application/components/main/index.html That points to where all the users are redirected after they sign in.. obviously this is a very unattractive URL, and what I'd love is quite simply: https://app.mydomain.com without the hassle of redoing my links, setting up my folders differently, etc.. Is there a way to link the original URL to the simple one without having to do too much extra work? I looked up domain masking, I'm not sure if that's exactly what I want, but I'm using Namecheap and Cloudflare, and it seems like you can't do masking with Cloudflare... What would I have to do to achieve this? Thanks!  submitted by /u/inceptive [link] [comments]
