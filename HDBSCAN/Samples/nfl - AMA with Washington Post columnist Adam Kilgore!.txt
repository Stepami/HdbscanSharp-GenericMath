AMA with Washington Post columnist Adam Kilgore!
Hi I'm Adam Kilgore. I've worked at The Washington Post continuously for seven and a half years and nearly 10 years all together. I covered the Nationals for five seasons, and now I kind of do a little of a lot in Sports section. That includes sharing my thoughts on the NFL every morning, observing the major story lines each week and spinning them forward to explain why they matter and provide insight into what's coming next. I'm a terrible golfer and a new father, and the former isn't helping the latter. Ask me anything! Proof EDIT: Big thanks to the r/nfl mods for allowing me to do this as well! EDIT 2: And I'm all done! That was a lot of fun. Thanks for the great questions. Tweet me if you have any more questions! Thanks again to r/nfl for this great opportunity.  submitted by /u/washingtonpost [link] [comments]
