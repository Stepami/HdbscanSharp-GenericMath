/u/Screye on [Discussion] I'm an undergraduate in CS and just entered my final year. I have an idea for a final year project in computer vision. I want to achieve a top grade in this but I'm afraid I don't have enough knowledge to do so. What do you recommend?
Listen to this guy OP. Choose a more focussed project and try to deliver in execution.
