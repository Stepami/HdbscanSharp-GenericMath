/u/UrbanDryad on Las Vegas faces approx. $40M in Education Budget Cuts
Okay, I get all that, but WHY do rich people send their children to private schools? Is it because they are better or worse?  To get away from the poor kids (who are less prepared, less well-supported, and tend to be slower learners and have more disruptive behavior.) Over time, bad companies go out of business and the good ones take over. The bigger the market, the faster the change.  The free market does poorly with complex "products" that are life essentials, especially when the results won't be seen for multiple years. Again...what has been found in ALL THE PLACES where this is tried is that student achievement overall drops. You realize this debate isn't hypothetical right? It's been tried. It doesn't work as well as what we have now. It takes multiple years to prove the trend. By the time you have proven it the damage is done. The former schools were already shuttered. The former structures in place already gone. The staff of qualified, experienced teachers scattered to the wind or moved to other states. Multiple years of student education is flushed down the drain. And now you have to rebuild it all?
