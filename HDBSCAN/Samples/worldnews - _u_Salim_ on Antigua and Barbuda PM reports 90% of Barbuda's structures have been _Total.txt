/u/Salim_ on Antigua and Barbuda PM reports 90% of Barbuda's structures have been "Totally Demolished"
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Take 1 look at Florida on google maps and tell me where people need to drive to get out of the hurricane's way. Now consider Florida's very dense population and the amount of traffic buildup from people leaving the state (you can only go North til you reach the panhandle). The only way to go is North, and a massive number of people are clogging up the highways trying to get out. Now imagine moving extremely slowly on a highway (which wastes all your fucking gas as your car is still on and moving). Once you run out of gas, your car is gonna stay right there and clog up the road some more. If you manage to get to a gas station, it will be packed to the brim with cars, not to mention fights breaking out. I'm a goddamn Floridian and it takes long enough to get out-of-state without a fucking hurricane on people's heels. You wanna throw that 60 hours to Alabama out there, but it's much closer to 60 hours+ just to reach the Florida-Georgia border with a fucking big hurricane behind everybody. Still plenty of fucking time?
