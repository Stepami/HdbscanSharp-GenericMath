/u/moeloubani on Trump calls Netanyahu 'a bigger problem' than Abbas: reports
Proved? LOL Come on now buddy, I really hope you don't think you 'proved' anything. Your argument is the 'I have a black friend so I can't be racist' or 'some Nazis were Jewish so the Nazis couldn't have hated Jews' argument. It's a stupid argument that makes no sense. Just because Israeli Arabs are treated properly inside of Israel it doesn't mean that Israel isn't placing the Palestinians in the West Bank under a system of apartheid, which it is. What I wrote above was true - Israel continues to deny people citizenship based on their ethnicity. Apartheid Israel even goes so far as to do blood tests on people to determine if their blood is 'pure' enough or if they are the right ethnicity. Imagine, a state that has refused to allow Syrian refugees simply because they are the wrong ethnicity. Refused to allow people who once lived there to return because they are the wrong ethnicity. What a white nationalist dream apartheid Israel is.
