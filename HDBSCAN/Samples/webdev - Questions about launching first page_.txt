Questions about launching first page.
So I did it. I did some udemy class and spent the past 2 weeks learning the basics of html/css/js/jquery. I want to find some place where I can launch it. I'm not looking for a unique or clever domain name or anything. Just a place for web hosting/domain name, that is hopefully free. I just want something I can put for a link on my github or just to send to a couple people. I am currently working on my own project, from what I've learned in this course. Nowhere near done. I am just making the bare bones of it to be functional and will launch that eventually. That is one that I am probably going to buy a cheap domain name for, from godaddy or something. Thank you in advance. Once again, this place is great. I posted a few weeks back and you guys set me on a good path which lead me here ;D  submitted by /u/placebojones88 [link] [comments]
