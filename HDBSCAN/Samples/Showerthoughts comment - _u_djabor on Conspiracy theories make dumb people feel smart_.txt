/u/djabor on Conspiracy theories make dumb people feel smart.
Of course. Do you really think i'd waste my time investing any time, effort or thought in to such a nutcase? I'd be disappointed with myself if anything i said to someone with that username was somehow interpreted as any kind of effort. Love your attempt at chiming in though....you entered into what must be the dumbest discussion on reddit ever, with a comment designed to make you feel superior...let that sink in...
