Visual studio community edition commercial use and licensing headaches
I run a small startup company with 7 developers including me and I have 3 Visual Studio professional licenses, can I download and use Visual Studio Community edition for the remaining 4 developers?. The reason I ask this is because, I have been doing for the last 2 years now. My work involved doing small websites for overseas and local companies, my annual turnover is less than 1 million USD and I have around 15 pcs in all, some guys purportedly from M.S are insisting that we can't use community version for commercial development and that if we do so, revenue generated from the same needs to be shared with Microsoft. These guys who claim to be from M.S ( I suspect that they are Microsoft authorized re-sellers) and are harassing me and threatening me with legal action, I would like to know if what they say is indeed true because purchasing 4 licenses immediately is pretty expensive for me. I read the T&A and it does mention that Organizations which are not enterprises can use the Community edition if they are not an Enterprise for like 5 concurrent users. I should mention that I am in India. Edit: They have further informed me that I can't use Visual Studio Express for developing applications and selling them as that goes against Microsoft licensing laws, they are asking me to submit to a SAM audit, I don't trust these guys because they are also asking me to buy software that I don't need like Office 2016 and MSDN subscription for each user.  submitted by /u/horusporcus [link] [comments]
