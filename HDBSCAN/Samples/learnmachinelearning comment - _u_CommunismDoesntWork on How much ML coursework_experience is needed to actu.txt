/u/CommunismDoesntWork on How much ML coursework/experience is needed to actually be able to work in the industry?
I saw a post that Houston might not be as competitive as other regions.  That's pretty awesome. I'm actually living in houston too, and going to UH for my MS in CS. Since you're actually in the industry, and they're training you, do you mind checking out this poll I made? Knowing what you know now, I'd like to get your opinion on it.
