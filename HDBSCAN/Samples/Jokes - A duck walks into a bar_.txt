A duck walks into a bar...
And orders a hundred bottles of scotch. The bartender says, "That's gonna be pretty expensive. How are you gonna pay for all that liquor?" The duck replies, "Just put it on my tab." A nearby bar patron cheekily says, "Don't you mean 'put it on my bill'?" The duck says to the bartender, "Okay, put it on his bill."  submitted by /u/tacofop [link] [comments]
