/u/Captain_Lonk on Bungie, please show the faction rank on the faction emblem
Some things in life should be earned, an emblem is representative of your skills in Destiny, in D1 they were frequently used as indicators of a players skill, in D2 this holds even more true. I appreciate some might not like this but put it to you like this, say you had the crucible KAD emblem, if a player chose to disable their stats they would be admitting to being ppor players anyway? So whats the point in having the option to disable it?
