How do I open a Facebook url in the app on mobile view and the full page version on the desktop?
I've been able to get the page to open on the web page on the computer using standard url - https://www.facebook.com/FaceBookPageName and opening on the app using the app deep link on the phone - fb://page/FacebookPageId but I cant figure out how to use both links because - fb://page/FacebookPageId doesn't work on the desktop. Thanks for the help. :)  submitted by /u/MilkyLlama [link] [comments]
