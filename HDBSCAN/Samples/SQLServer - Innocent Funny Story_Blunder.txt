Innocent Funny Story/Blunder
I've been a DBA for about 4 years, and today I did something incredibly stupid. Chapter 8, Creating Tables Altering Schemas etc. EZ peasy. I ran my query ALTER SCHEMA production transfer sales.categories; GO It returned me this error. Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 24 Cannot find the object 'categories', because it does not exist or you do not have permission. I proceed to dig into security settings, look at schema metadata, transfer DB owner ect. I still get the error. In my righteous fury I decide "IT MUST BE EXPRESS" (this is why you dont study tired) and download 2016 enterprise from www.dreamspark.com. I create my DB, do my initial backup and restore the DB. Then I do my alter schema. Same error, by now I am frothing at the mouth in a rage that Khorne himself would be proud of. I close my eyes for one second, open them. My god im a bleeping idiot, its production.categories not sales.categories.. OMW to liquor store.  submitted by /u/MrSolitaire [link] [comments]
