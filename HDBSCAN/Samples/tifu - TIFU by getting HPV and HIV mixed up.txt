TIFU by getting HPV and HIV mixed up
This happened yesterday. Well not really, as 'sex' things have to be posted in the weekend on this sub so really it happened yesterday plus half a day As the title says 'Today I fucked Up by getting HPV and HIV mixed up' So awhile ago I got the vaccination to be immune from HPV... Fast forward to yesterday-ish; me and my GF are about to do the sex for the first time but I ask if she has any STD/I's. My GF says she has HIV. I'm a bit annoyed that she hadn't told me when we first met but I don't wanna miss out on sexy time (shes like a 8.5/10 so I can forgive her for not telling me as why would I turn someone like that down) so I say "it's fine, I've had the injections so I'm immune". So we get going. It was amazing, I wish I lasted longer though. Anyway back on topic... ...In the morning I wake up and think I realize my mistake, but just to be sure I double check by asking GF if she had HPV or HIV. My heart skipped a beat when she said HIV. So now I'm booked in to be tested for HIV and other stuff whilst I'm at it, hopefully the condom did it's job. TL;DR: I'm immune to HPV (had the vaccination years ago), went to have some fun time with GF, found out she has HIV but got it mixed up with HPV, now I might have HIV... Edits/Updates: None yet, will post test results here though. Fixed up the first bracket part as it sounded rude before Spelling   submitted by /u/00110110-00111001 [link] [comments]
