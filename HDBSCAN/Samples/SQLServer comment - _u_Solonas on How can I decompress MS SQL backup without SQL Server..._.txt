/u/Solonas on How can I decompress MS SQL backup without SQL Server...?
You have to weigh backup time and space with restore time. Yes, straight DD dedupe is great, but do some tests on various databases to see how quickly they restore. If recovery time is at all important to your organization then absolutely test this. In my last company our tests found that the total restore time (including database restore) from the data domain for uncompressed backups on a 2TB DB was slower than compressed backups stored on DD (we used litespeed instead of native)...significantly. If these are critical databases that will cost your company thousands of dollars per minute of downtime then you should have some idea about which of these will cost the company the least in the event you have to restore.
