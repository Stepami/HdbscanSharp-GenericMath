/u/billwoo on Is Starcraft 2 really a harder game for AI than Go?
Go on the other hand has all these complex patterns that can arise which makes it harder.  Why would you think Go has more complex patterns than Starcraft when it has so many bounds on its state (fixed size discrete board, pieces have simple discrete states, etc.)? In Starcraft the board is continuous and varying, and the pieces have many associated states some of which are also continuous. It also has many more types of decisions on top of piece positioning, such as builds, upgrades. I think the optimal play of Starcraft hasn't even been scratched, it seems there should be plenty of opportunity for optimal positioning, perfect timing of power usage, that a human simply isn't capable of. It occurs to me after writing this, that perhaps you mean harder to beat a human at, however I think my points still apply somewhat.
