As long as the AI systems we build are focused on imitating the data they receive and not understanding it, there is danger. Human beings, despite being ignorant, are capable of being better informed. However, for a variety of reasons, humans choose not to attempt to fix their flaws. An AI can be forced to do such a thing. Also, we can't generally kill a human being for being ignorant. We can shut down an AI if learns the 'wrong things'. I think we'll be fine.
