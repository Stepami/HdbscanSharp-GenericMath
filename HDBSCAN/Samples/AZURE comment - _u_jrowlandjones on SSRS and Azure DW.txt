/u/jrowlandjones on SSRS and Azure DW
Hi bobotski, Please can you clarify if you mean Azure SQL Data Warehouse or Azure Analysis Services (AAS). In your comment you mention Azure DW but also use the word "tabular" which suggests AAS. AAS supports connections using Azure Active Directory (AAD) or Windows Authentication (WA). You can learn how to create these connection strings here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-connect. For connecting to Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQLDW) then I suggest starting with this resource https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication Hope that helps! Please post back if you have any other questions. JRJ
