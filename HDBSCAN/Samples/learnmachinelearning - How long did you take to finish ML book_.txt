How long did you take to finish ML book?
I'm curious for those who learn from the book, how long did you take to finish the book like from cover to cover? Please say your book title and number of days/months. I'm looking forward to these books: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop  The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie and Tibshirani  Deep Learning by Goodfellow and Bengio    submitted by /u/YLTO [link] [comments]
