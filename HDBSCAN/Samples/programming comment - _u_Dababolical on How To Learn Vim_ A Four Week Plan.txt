/u/Dababolical on How To Learn Vim: A Four Week Plan
Do a lot of web development jobs assume competency in Vim since its on every linux dristro? Or does it just depend on the place. Sorry if you're not in a place to answer and the question is off topic. I only ask because I don't know it yet but it is on my to learn list, but I'm not sure how much I should prioritize it since I'm enjoying PyCharm and VSCode. I do want to land a job in the industry eventually.
