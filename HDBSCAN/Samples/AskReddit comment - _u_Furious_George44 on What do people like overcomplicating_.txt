if you don't check your noodles continuously for firmness and take them off soon enough, you're going to make mushy noodles  I think Americans like mushy spaghetti though. There's the guide that sticking a noodle to the refrigerator tells you when it's done and the vast majority of restaurants overcook their pasta. Seems to be the preferred style here for some reason.
