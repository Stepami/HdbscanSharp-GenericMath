TIFU by playing on a children's playground slide
Obligatory "I lost my phone because of a certain someone that happened to pick it off the ground after I dropped it and ran away with it". Apology for a lengthy into. Basically, this was a chain of ill luck leading up to the climax, as said in the title. A primary school reunion had been long overdue, so our class met up at a playground near our mentioned primary school. Since I had already lost my phone before this and was unable to get a replacement for the time being, I ended up having to borrow several people's phones. Anyhoo. Some idiotic child had left a packet of rice there, which were spilled across the entire platform of the swing, and had rotted to black, slimy masses. And yours truly had been equally stupid and blind to not have noticed them, or smelled the rotting rice, and stepped on the rotting rice, making me bump and crash down the slide (clearly meant for a child, not a 50 kg/110 pound female), landing on a nearby metal fixture and getting a deep (albeit small) cut on my forehead. Resulting in excessive bleeding over a playground meant for kids, a trip to the hospital that required 6 stitches and an MRI. TL;DR Don't play with equipment meant for kids, and watch out for slimy, rotting rice that some idiotic child left out to rot.  submitted by /u/anpanthundr [link] [comments]
