Beautiful soup? justtext? dragnet? Not super happy with any of these. Maybe I'm using them wrong? Advice on the best way to reliably pull text from a large number of varied websites. Beginner ooking for advice from the veteran data miners.
I'm working on a project that pulls text from sites. At one point or another, I've used all of these packages and I feel like I find instances where they let me down. Is there any advice you guys can give me on a strong way pull text from pages? Maybe running them all and having a way to dynamically choose among their outputs??? Not really sure tho  submitted by /u/findandwrite [link] [comments]
