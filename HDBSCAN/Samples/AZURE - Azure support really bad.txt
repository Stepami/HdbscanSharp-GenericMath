Azure support really bad
Azure support has been really bad. I have EA standard, I'm not doing anything critical, but I expect them to answer the tickets. Instead they answer within the first 2 hours saying that they have taken on the ticket, and will look into it, then it takes days for any reaction. What support plans do you have? Amazon is 1000 times better at this.  submitted by /u/basejumping [link] [comments]
