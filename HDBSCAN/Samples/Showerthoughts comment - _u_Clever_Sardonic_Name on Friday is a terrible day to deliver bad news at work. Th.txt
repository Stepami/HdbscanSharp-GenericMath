/u/Clever_Sardonic_Name on Friday is a terrible day to deliver bad news at work. The recipient can't do anything about it - job hunt, talk to a co-worker, etc. - until Monday.
This is more than a shower thought. It is really sound advice. HR people of Reddit: please champion this. People need to be let go, laid off, and even fired. Give them the ability to pick up the pieces while there are plenty of buisness days left in the week. I was fired for the first time, from a 10 year job, then laid off of the very next job I got. That was in March of this year. While both were rough, they were early in the week and I was able to channel the awkwardness into a recovery plan. Much harder to do if there's a weekend to stew over everything. IMHO
