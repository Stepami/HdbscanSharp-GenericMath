How do you find cool places to work at? (Not Big N)
I'm a 1 year Dev that is looking for a new gig. I'd like to try to find a company outside the Big N, and I'm willing to relocate. I just have no idea on how to find companies that are actually doing cool/exciting stuff; especially smaller companies. How have other redditors navigated this situation?  submitted by /u/flaming_sousa [link] [comments]
