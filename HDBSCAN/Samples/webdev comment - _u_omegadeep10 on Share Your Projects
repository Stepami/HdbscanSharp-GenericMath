This is awesome! You're awesome. I didn't know I needed this until right now. I usually lurk in all the various book subreddits but this is a much nicer process now. Couple thoughts Like the idea of viewing books by threads, but I miss not seeing the comment text that described the book. Often what convinces me to try a book is a redditor's glowing review of it. Though to be fair a lot of recommendation threads are literally just people posting a Goodreads link.  UI is pretty, but I'd like to see...more? The low data density makes it tiring to keep scrolling to find more. Perhaps visualization options could be explored here, such as book cover grid (click to see details), or table with no images, collapsible threads, etc.  Trends. What books have been mentioned a lot in a particular subreddit or thread? Which books consistently get a lot of upvotes? Which books have just recently been mentioned a lot? What are some "top" books in a subreddit?  You use Amazon, so is there a way of telling me if a book is available on Amazon Unlimited? Or discounted, on sale, etc.  Maybe more than Amazon? Google Books, Barnes and Nobles, etc. They probably have affiliate links too, not sure. With pricing information?
