We're opening up mod apps, look inside for more info!
Good morning, afternoon, evening and night r/leagueoflegends - It's that time of year again, the time where we open up our team to some new faces. We've decided that our response times and activity are a bit low, and that some new opinions on how the sub is run will do us some good. As such, we are opening up some moderator applications and expect to be bringing on new people by Halloween. Currently, the team is looking to bring on as many mods as we see fit. We care about what you put in here and your thoughts. Be honest with your answers and feel free to take as much space as you need. It's going to take a fair bit of time to fill out an application, so we'll be having them open for a week until 10/10/2017 at 12PM PST. But please take your time, feel free to modmail us with any issues and we will be able to help. Comments below can be used about overall questions as well, both are appropriate methods!
