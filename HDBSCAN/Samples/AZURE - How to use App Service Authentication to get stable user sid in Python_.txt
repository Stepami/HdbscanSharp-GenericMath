How to use App Service Authentication to get stable user sid in Python?
Noob here. I'm coding a simple API project in Python that would let users upload and access files. I'll be using App Service Authentication. When a file is uploaded from the user, it will be saved in a blob container that incorporates the user's stable sid (the user will not access the container directly). I found this page that details how to get a user's stable sid: https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-server/wiki/Understanding-User-Ids My question is: how can I do what is described in this link but using Python? I can't find the corresponding class or functions anywhere in the library. Any help is greatly appreciated!  submitted by /u/HandwovenBox [link] [comments]
