/u/Fizzlerr on Advice for learning coding, currently working through freecodecamp beginner course what should I do next
In agreement with some other comments: I only suggest making a game because a) it interests you and b) it will generate challenge for you to overcome because you will have a vision and settle for nothing less. Having said that, graphics is its own animal. I'm working on my compsci PhD and I won't touch graphics with a 10 foot pole. It's usually infuriatingly unintuitive, clunky, ugly, complicated, or any combination there of. GUI development is an art not a science. You should probably learn the science first and only explore the art if you have the patience or talent.
