/u/raisinhavok on Google’s actions make it more important than ever that we stand up to fight monopolies.” per Zephyr Teachout
I'm confused by this not the article it self ,but the idea expressed. If I was to start an business and become the greatest in whatever field it is. I work hard to get there ,and then what? I get there I'm not supposed to try to do good and continue to be the best? That's where I don't understand the idea of people going after companies because they are so powerful in the certain area well. I didn't start my company to be mediocre. I started my company so I could provide a service to be the best in it. From what I see this is someone's getting mad at Google because they are trying to get more business for themselves. Shouldn't you try to get more business? If you don't get any business then won't your company fail? I'm just confused I'm not sideing either way ,but to me this seems like for example how little league nowadays both teams get a trophy or mental. No there needs to be a winner and there needs to be a loser both teams can't win that doesn't make sense. That takes all the competition out of stuff. If everyone's striving to be the same then what's the point of even trying? You're already the same as everybody else so why try harder? but that's just how I feel about it but like I said I am no expert in anything that is related to monopolies or anything like that. Can someone please shed some light and try to help understand why striving to be the best is now a bad thing. I know that there is alot more to it but to me that's what it boils down to imo. At the moment hopefully some one can enlighten me
