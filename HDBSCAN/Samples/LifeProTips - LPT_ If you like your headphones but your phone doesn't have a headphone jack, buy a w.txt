LPT: If you like your headphones but your phone doesn't have a headphone jack, buy a wireless receiver. It's small enough to keep in your pocket and you can connect to any Bluetooth device!
If you have a detachable cable you can use velcro to stick the receiver on your headphones and run a short cable, quick and easy wireless headphones.  submitted by /u/Purphoros12 [link] [comments]
