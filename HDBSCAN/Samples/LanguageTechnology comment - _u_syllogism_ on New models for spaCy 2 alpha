/u/syllogism_ on New models for spaCy 2 alpha -- now near state-of-the-art (NER: 86.4 F on OntoNotes; parsing: 94.4 UAS on WSJ)
For context: the latest NER results are around 87% on OntoNotes. On the Wall Street Journal evaluation, spaCy's accuracy is now similar to Google's "Parsey McParseface". Both are significantly behind the top accuracy on that benchmark of 95.7, from Dozat and Manning. The current alpha models are running at about 8,000 words per second on a reasonably powerful CPU, using multiple threads. I consider this a bit slow for serious use. The stable release should be 4-5x faster, even at the expense of some accuracy.
