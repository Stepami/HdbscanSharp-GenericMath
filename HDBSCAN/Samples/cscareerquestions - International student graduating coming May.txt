International student graduating coming May
I am currently double majoring in CSC and Math. I do have OPT (optional practical training) period, but I was wondering what my plans should look like in order to continue working here in the US. I am currently applying to internships for Spring semester that would transition into a full-time job after graduating; what else should/could I be doing?  submitted by /u/r0mani [link] [comments]
