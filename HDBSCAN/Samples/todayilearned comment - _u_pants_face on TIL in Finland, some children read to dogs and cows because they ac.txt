/u/pants_face on TIL in Finland, some children read to dogs and cows because they actually like listening and are extremely attentive.
Many local SPCAs and Humane Societies have programs like this. They're always looking for volunteers even if all you do is sit in the cage with the dog and listen to music/ read/ give them pets.
