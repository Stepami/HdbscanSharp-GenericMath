Water Cooler Wednesday
Welcome to another edition of the Water Cooler Wednesday thread - where /r/nfl'ers can discuss their lives and get to know each other better. This is the place to post things that wouldn't ordinarily be considered on-topic in /r/nfl. Did you meet a player that you got a picture with? Have a cool story about how you became a fan of your team? Write an NFL related blog post? Make a cool .gif? Is your car painted your team color? Snap a cool picture at the game last week? Have a shrine to your favorite player? Want to talk about something that doesn't really deserve its own thread? Post here! Remember, that there are other subreddits that may be a good fit for what you want to post - every day all day! /r/NFLFandom for showing off your fandom /r/NFL_Draft for talking in depth about the draft /r/nflblogs for posting blog posts - including your own /r/nflofftopic for talking about anything with NFL fans /r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu for all kinds of humor posts /r/nflcirclejerk for when /r/NFL just becomes too much ... and more - see the sidebar!   submitted by /u/NFL_Mod [link] [comments]
