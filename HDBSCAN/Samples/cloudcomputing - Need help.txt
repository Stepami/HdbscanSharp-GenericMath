Need help
So I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post in, but I have a problem and wondered if cloud computing was the answer. I've been managing some Instagram accounts and uploading content using the desktop app Gramblr. Using the app I can schedule posts and it will upload the content, but my laptop must be turned on (sleep mode is ok) and connected to wifi. Is there anyway to set this process up so that the files are stored on the cloud and a cloud computed runs Gramblr so the content is uploaded. My aim is to set this process up so that once I've scheduled the content it's able to upload even if my laptop is off or without internet.  submitted by /u/help-you-instagrow [link] [comments]
