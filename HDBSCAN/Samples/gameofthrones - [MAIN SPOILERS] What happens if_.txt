[MAIN SPOILERS] What happens if...
What would've happened if Catelyn and Tyrion hadn't crossed paths at the inn in season 1? That one amazing coincidence basically set in motion all the wars to come. If Catelyn doesn't take Tyrion, Jamie doesn't attack Ned. If Ned hadn't been attacked, he would've left Kings Landing, never have discovered the truth about Joffrey, and never have been taken captive, which means Robb wouldn't have declared war. Also, if Catelyn doesn't take Tyrion, no war in the Riverlands. So basically Littlefinger got insanely lucky that Catelyn happened to come across Tyrion. Obviously he then capitalized on that by delaying Ned's departure from the capital until Jamie could attack him, but still, pretty crazy luck. P.S. on the subject of Littlefinger's luck, 99.9% of the time, Renly becomes king and Littlefinger's position stays the same or becomes slightly worse, but Renly just so happened to get stabbed by a demon baby, which allowed Littlefinger to parlay with the Tyrells, which in turn made him Lord of Harrenhal, which then allowed him to take power in the Vale.  submitted by /u/wacthc [link] [comments]
