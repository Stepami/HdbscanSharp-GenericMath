How would I compare two same API queries with different timestamps and store that difference elsewhere?
So right now I'm planning to use CRON to run a daily php script. That script will do an API call for a specific email, it will then parse that API data and store it with the email in an SQL database. Then in the next 24 hours, the CRON script will run again, query the same api call for the same user, and if there is a difference, it will override the current user data, but it will also trigger an e-mail to that user that there is an addition in data to that account and tell the user what it is. I think I have just answered my own question on how to do it but if there is something that i'm looking over please feel free to guide me. for each user in this table { run api query, parse it into a temp variable. if no data is found is found for the user{ store data } else if no difference is found {do nothing} else if there is a difference { override old data and email new data to user } end  submitted by /u/toonwarrior [link] [comments]
