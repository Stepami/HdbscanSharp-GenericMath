/u/jsickboy on If we allowed people to adopt tigers as pets, we'd probably save the tiger population while getting our own population under control at the same time.
oh I guess you'd have to know Florida a bit... it's because people in Florida thought having pythons as pets was a good idea. Once the pythons get too big, they just release them. Now Florida has a terrible wild python problem because they have no predators in the area. In other words, they were never good "pets"
