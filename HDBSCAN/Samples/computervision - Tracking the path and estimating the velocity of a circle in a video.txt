Tracking the path and estimating the velocity of a circle in a video
Hello, I'm trying to create a program that does something similar to the video here. But I'm a bit stumped as to how to start. My current thinking is since the object is a circular, - I can define a ROI, - use an algorithm from the OpenCV tracker class to detect the movement of the ROI, - detect circles within the ROI - Draw a line on the centre coordinates of the detected circle - Calculate Velocity (bonus) My issue currently is that I don't think this method is robust enough. - - For example, there can be multiple circles in the ROI, this isn't much of a problem as I can just define to find for the biggest circle. But I struggle to detect circles within the ROI anyway I've tried implementing other techniques such as background subtraction but I'm not sure if this works best for my use case. This is because, I'm not sure you can define a certain part of the frame to perform background subtraction on. if you're using the whole frame, there are other moving objects in the frame such as the lifter and people walking in the background etc. Regarding estimating the velocity of the bar, I'm completely stumped and not sure where to start.  TL:DR Essentially, I'm trying to define a region where the plates on the bar are in a video and track the barpath in the video. How do I start? There are similar apps that achieve what I'm trying to do but I'm trying to create a simple lightweight version for personal purposes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKx_No-yDww Any ideas are welcome.
