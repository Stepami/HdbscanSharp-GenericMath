Does anybody have callibration pictures taken with a fisheye lens camera?
Hi I would like to try to callibrate a fisheye camera. Issue is that I don't have a fisheye camera. I calibrated a "normal" (non-fisheye) twice so far and would really like to try a fisheye camera once. Does anybody of you have such pictures/video taken with a fisheye lens, or know where I can find such pictures/video online?: https://youtu.be/v7jutAmWJVQ?t=91 If you have such pictures or a video where you move such a chessboard and record/photograph it with a fisheye lens, feel free to either post it/them here or send it/them to me via PM. I'll make sure to write it in this post if someone sends me pictures via PM, so that there are is not a second person who does unnecessary effort. Personally I think a video might be the easiest, because as you can see the person in the video even took 50 pictures. Thank you in advance  submitted by /u/the3liquid [link] [comments]
