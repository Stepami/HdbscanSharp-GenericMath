Yes, but it didn't really mean much. At the time, every year they were making a ship that was the largest in the world so far. The famous Lusitania was the largest ship in the world when it was launched in 1907, then it was surpassed by the Mauretania a year later, then the Olympic, the Titanic's brother and first of its class was the largest in 1911. The Titanic, which was Olympic-class and identical to the Olympic only with slightly larger tonnage, became the largest when it was launched, but at the time Germany was already constructing three different ships that were all larger than the Titanic, and were launched only a year after the Titanic sank. So, if anything, the Titanic wasn't the first of its class (that was the Olympic) and was only the largest ship ever for less than a year. Honestly, it's only so famous because it sank, otherwise it would've gone down in history books as just yet another ship.
