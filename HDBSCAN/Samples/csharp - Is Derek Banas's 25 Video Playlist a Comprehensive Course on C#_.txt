Is Derek Banas's 25 Video Playlist a Comprehensive Course on C#?
I want to learn C# and was wondering if completing Derek Banas's playlist on C# would be enough for me to be well versed enough in the language to create my own projects. Does anyone have experience going through all the videos and could you comment on how confident you are in the language after doing so?  submitted by /u/SacrificialLamb [link] [comments]
