Summoner Specialist + Revive: A new way to make competitive games exciting
I was browsing a thread earlier about players who still had old summoner spells selected and were able to use them for a while when I remembered the brand new rune coming up called Summoner Specialist. Summoner Specialist allows a player to change their summoner spell every so often using tokens they get for using existing summoner spells, allowing them to do things like trading ignite for teleport on top laners. What if the old Revive spell was brought back in with an 8 minute cooldown allow players to exchange one of their summoners and revive instantly, almost similar to the Buyback option in DOTA 2 which allows you to revive yourself instantly in exchange for gold Revive with an 8 minute cooldown would be easily balancable with the Summoner's Specialist combination, ensuring that you're actually taking a huge risk by picking revive since you can only gain stacks by using summoner spells and there's a pretty reasonable gap between when you'd be able to trade Revive back for your previous summoner spell. Imagine a scenario where a team barely gets aced at Baron and the winning side marches towards their nexus but two players on the team running Summoner's Specialist trade in their flashes for Revive and get one last attempt at holding down the base before the end of the game. Or perhaps a team gets aced in mid lane 40 minutes in with enemy nexus towers down and the team's jungler trades in Flash/Smite for Teleport/Revive and teleports straight into the enemy's base instantly starting a race against time and forcing split-second decision making from both teams. It's just something neat that could bring a lot of really interesting cheese comps in competitive play, especially somewhere in the LCS where the format has been changed to a Bo1 format.  submitted by /u/SingSillySongs [link] [comments]
