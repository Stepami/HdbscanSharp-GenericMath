Tips for undergrad research
I just got accepted into a research position and I'm excited but I wanna know if you guys have any tips for me. This is my first time ever doing research and I want to do the best that I can. I am a second semester sophomore (4th semester in college). The research will be in HCI and Cyberlearning  submitted by /u/justan0therlurker [link] [comments]
