Which Western Conference team is #1 at being in the west?
With the recent discussion regarding Hornets skill at being in the East, /u/BrotherSeamus revealed that the Portland Trailblazers were #1 at being in the West. I walk past the construction site of the Warriors new Chase Arena every day, and I wondered if moving across the bay, a distance of approximately 13 miles, would bump them up in the standings. Below are my findings. Figure 1, a map showing the locations of Oracle and Chase Arenas: https://imgur.com/OGux5kO Figure 2, a map showing the locations of the Top 4 teams at being in the West: https://imgur.com/tj0c4gE Figure 3, the Westerness of each team, and their Miles Back (MB) from the leader: Rank Team Longitude MB   #1 Vancouver Grizzlies 123.108889 0  #2 Portland Trailblazers -122.666842 30.5  #3 San Francisco Warriors -122.387568 49.77  #4 Seattle SuperSonics -122.353977 52.09  #5 Oakland Warriors -122.203067 62.5    While the construction of the new Chase Arena still leaves the top currently real team Portland at #2, it does allow the GSW to move from position #4 to position #3, bumping the SuperSonics from #3 to #4 by a distance of just over two miles. For the longitude of each arena, I just zoomed in on google maps and clicked in the center of the arena. For the new Chase Arena, Google had a few different ideas about where the arena was actually going to be, so I clicked in the middle of "Lot E", which is the current construction site. I approximated 69 miles for the distance of 1degree longitude. Thank you. **edit: It was brought to my attention the Grizzlies played in Vancouver. My presentation is bad and I feel bad.  submitted by /u/chancefire [link] [comments]
