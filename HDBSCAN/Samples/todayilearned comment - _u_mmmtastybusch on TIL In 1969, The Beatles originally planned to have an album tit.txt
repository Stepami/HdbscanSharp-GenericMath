/u/mmmtastybusch on TIL In 1969, The Beatles originally planned to have an album titled Everest. However, the band didn't want to travel all the way to Mount Everest for the album cover photoshoot. This lead album title changing to Abbey Road, which was the street right outside their studio.
Yea the 2004 version. I think it was the random barnyard noises and stuff that really threw me. Maybe I'll give it another shot. Like I said, my expectations were probably lifted way too high by the reviews I'd read haha. I'm the opposite been a fan since I was a kid but drifted away from them until watching Love and Mercy. Surfs Up and Heroes and Villains were about the only songs I cared for. I'll check out the live version!
