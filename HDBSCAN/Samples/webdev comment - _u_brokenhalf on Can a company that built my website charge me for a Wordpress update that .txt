/u/brokenhalf on Can a company that built my website charge me for a Wordpress update that broke it?
Doesn't all code get frozen on release?  If the code was all yours then yes, that would normally be how it would go. You utilize Wordpress though, all bets are off because the code you use is used by millions of other entities and seen by lots of other people. If a bug or flaw were to be found by one of those other people, they could attack your website. So Wordpress is sort of maintaining the code base for your website to keep it secure. Those changes can destroy custom modifications done by your contractor since neither your web developer nor Wordpress have a crystal ball and see what code could potentially be a problem in the future. Why should you expect your web developer to work for free when this isn't their fault?
