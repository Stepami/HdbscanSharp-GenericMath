Unable to load referenced assemblies after Deployment to Azure App Service
we are following plugin architecture, so we are having other projects which can plugin into the main web application. Folder structure: --MVC Application -- bin --Plugins -- Plugin1 -- dlls -- Plugin2 --dlls When I published my MVC application to Azure App service.The dlls present in the main web application only got copied.How can I move the dlls present in my plugins folder. When I try to run the application it is not loading the scripts and dlls present in other plugin folders. Can some one please let me know how can I solve the issue and these plugins are dynamic. Based on the post build event, we are copying the dlls and scripts to respective plugin folders.  submitted by /u/AjayMadhu [link] [comments]
