/u/CJShort on Where is the promised SQ42 schedule report?
Why is it that whenever anyone asks anything critical of CIG, they're labeled trolls? Apparently I either shower CIG with praise or I refunded and suck Derek's dick. This sub is so culty that you completely forgot that people can be critical and not be trolling.
