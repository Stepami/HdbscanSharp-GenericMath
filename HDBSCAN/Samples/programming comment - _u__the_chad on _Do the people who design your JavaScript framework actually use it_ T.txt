/u/_the_chad on "Do the people who design your JavaScript framework actually use it? The answer for Angular 1 and 2 is no. This is really important."
I spent 2 years at a company developing applications that I'll never use myself. I worked on a product. Frameworks are also a product. I think the argument here is akin to "coffin makers don't use the coffins they build therefor it must be garbage/usesless/obsolete/etc". Secondly, Google has such talented engineers, why would you force engineers to a framework constraint? That would probably make senior engineers unhappy as it limits them to certain optimizations that could be done otherwise. I think a lot of you guys are thinking about this too simplistically and close to the ground. Frameworks are for people who don't know how to architect an application themselves. It enables common folk to get an application off the ground and running without worrying about all the subtleties and details in the background. Frameworks are the ez-bake ovens of development. Of course Google engineers don't use [many of] them.
