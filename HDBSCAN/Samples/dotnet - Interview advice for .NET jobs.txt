Interview advice for .NET jobs
Howdy folks, I've scoured a few threads on this sub about .NET interview questions and whatnot, and I'm trying to soak up as much as I can for an interview I have later this week for a .NET software engineer position. It's for a junior/new grad level job, so I'm hoping I won't be completely side blinded. My degree is in math/physics and not CS, so I think I'm going in already with a crutch compared to some of the other interviewees. I've been studying the standard technical questions from CTCI and grinding Leetcode, but I was wondering if there are any .NET specific things I brush up on as well. I've been using ASP.NET Core for a couple side projects/to learn the MS stack as much as I can while listening to every .NET related podcast I can get my ears on to assimilate myself to the ecosystem. The past few weeks, I've been focusing more on .NET specific things (LINQ, extensibility, design patterns, OOP with C#) and less so on the technical interview questions (probably not the best idea, but its overwhelming how much there is to the whole .NET sphere). Are there specific things I really dig into as to not embarrass myself for the interview? Any and all advice is much appreciated! EDIT: I cannot thank you wonderful people enough, there's a BUNCH of awesome advice here that has definitely given me more direction. THANK YOU!  submitted by /u/thunderfvck [link] [comments]
