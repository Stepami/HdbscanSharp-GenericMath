/u/CyberByte on A.I. ‘Bias’ Doesn’t Mean What Journalists Say it Means
There's no doubt that the media is often wrong about AI, and because this frustrates us (people in the field), they're an easy target for ridicule. Of course, they deserve to be called out when they're wrong, but while doing so it's important to make sure that we are right. Unfortunately, this article completely misses the point of bias in machine learning (see my response). Even though reporting on it is often bad, it is an important problem that we're going to need to address, and luckily people are doing that (see e.g. FATML).
