/u/samtldr on 30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty
That's not true. I'm not French, but I know that there is significantly less mass shootings in France than there is in the states. The attack you are referring to was organized and funded by an international terrorist organization and it is these attacks we would struggle to mitigate. Culture permitting, what we can mitigate, through gun control, is mass shootings done by any average joe just like our boy in vegas.(with a legal or illegal firearm(s)). I'm not saying this would work in the states as gun culture is already embedded too deeply and you already have too many firearms, but gun control DOES work.
