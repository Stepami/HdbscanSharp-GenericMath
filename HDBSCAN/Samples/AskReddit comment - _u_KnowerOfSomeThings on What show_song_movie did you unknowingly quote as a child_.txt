/u/KnowerOfSomeThings on What show/song/movie did you unknowingly quote as a child?
My farther would say, "Happy un-birthday", to everyone at someone's birthday party. I didn't put it together until later in life that he was semi-quoting Alice in Wonderland. My sister had no idea and later in life.. when someone wished her "Happy un-birthday" she was extremely confused how they knew of my father's famous tradition.
