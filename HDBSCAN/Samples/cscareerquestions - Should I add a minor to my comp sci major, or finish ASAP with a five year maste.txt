Should I add a minor to my comp sci major, or finish ASAP with a five year masters?
Im currently a sophomore in undergrad majoring in computer science! I was thinking about adding a minor, either finance or stats. The thing with finance at my university is that it requires a ton of prerequisites which will fill up my schedule. Math isn’t my strong suit, but I do enjoy it. If I do end up doing a minor, I won’t be eligible to enroll in a five year masters program at my university. I’m considering adding a minor to better prepare me for a decent career. I want to aim to be a competitive applicant for any CS job I apply to. My goal is to try and aim for a six figure salary as a software engineer after I complete my masters. Do you think that’s attainable? If you were in my position, would you add a minor (either finance or stats) and do a masters in two years, or simply stick to a comp sci major and apply for a five year masters? If I do the five year masters, I’d simultaneously be finishing my bachelors while starting my masters senior year.  submitted by /u/Paulinusia [link] [comments]
