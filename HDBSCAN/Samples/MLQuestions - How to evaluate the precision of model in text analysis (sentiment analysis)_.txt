How to evaluate the precision of model in text analysis (sentiment analysis)?
Hi redditers, I am a graduate student of social science and want to apply machine learning in analyzing sentiments embedded in texts. I have a manually coded data set which is about 25% of the total data and want to predict the cluster of rest 75%. My question is, after the model provides me the predicted cluster, how can I tell the precision? Should I use the model to predict the manually coded data so as to compare? Would this cause bias since this data is the source data for building model? Looking forward to getting response. Thank you very much.  submitted by /u/taowangkkk [link] [comments]
