/u/indiaredpill on ProjectFi, What's happened to us?
Continue to ask for improvement. I'll continue to be satisfied with the Google Fi service offerings and paying $10/gb.  If you are satisfied, then why not STFU? It's not like OP is asking Google to sell your inheritance to lower data costs. This is a situation in which you lose absolutely nothing from OP's demand. On the contrary, you stand to gain if Google accepts OP's demand. Yet, you continue to argue like a juvenile.
