/u/baconmastah on TIL in Finland, some children read to dogs and cows because they actually like listening and are extremely attentive.
Reminds me of this rabbit I used to visit everyday at this nature/animal preserve during summer camp. All the other rabbits were mellow, but pretty apathetic toward me. But this particular grey one seemed to always remember me. All I had to do was sit down and clap a couple of times and it'd hop into my lap. It didn't mind me picking it up and taking it places at all! Used to take it to the lounge chair and read a nice book with it parked on my lap.
