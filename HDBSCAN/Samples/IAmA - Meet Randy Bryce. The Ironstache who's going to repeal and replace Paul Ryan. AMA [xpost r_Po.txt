Ask questions over at r/Political_Revolution! My name is Randy Bryce. I'm a veteran, cancer survivor, and union ironworker from Caledonia, Wisconsin running to repeal and replace Paul Ryan in Wisconsin's First Congressional District. Post your questions at this thread and I'll be back at 11am CDT/12pm EDT to answer them! Ask me anything! p.s. We need your help to win this campaign. If you'd like to join the team, sign up here. If you don't have time to volunteer, we're currently fundraising to open our first office in Racine, Wisconsin. If you can help, contribute here and I'll send you a free campaign bumper sticker as a way of saying thanks!  submitted by /u/Tyree07 [link] [comments]
