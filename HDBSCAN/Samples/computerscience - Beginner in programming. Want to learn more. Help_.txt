Beginner in programming. Want to learn more. Help?
Hi everyone. So i think this is the best place to ask for advice and help. A little information first, I am not a complete stranger to coding. I do know javascript, and python and can understand html. What i really want help on is where do i go from here? I have no idea what to make or what to do and I want to build something. Even start out small is fine but I want to build my portfolio of projects and would really love suggestions/help on what i should do next and what I should make. Thanks.  submitted by /u/Nerdahan [link] [comments]
