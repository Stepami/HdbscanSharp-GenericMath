I am Andrew Rea (aka OliverBabish), the creator of Binging with Babish - I have a new show coming, a podcast, and my first book hits stores today! AMA!
My name is Andrew Rea (proof), but you probably know me better as Oliver Babish, the guy whose torso makes all the movie foods. I started the show about a year and a half ago, and thanks to Reddit, I've been able to make it my full-time job, and am super-excited to be expanding into other arenas of food media and entertainment. I had a fuggin blast during my first AMA back in February, and my book dropping onto shelves and into Amazon boxes today seemed as fitting an occasion as any to do it again! You guys might know me as a serial comment replier and an inadvisably open book, so I mean it when I say: AMA!! EDIT (11:30 EST): Holy shit guys, my inbox currently reads 800! I'm gonna be answering questions for as long as I can today, I'm very sorry if I don't get to yours, but I'll do my best! EDIT 2 (1PM EST): Whew okay had lunch quick - wow 1500 now. My poor fingies can't keep up but we'll persevere! I'm being told that the book is sold out Amazon, but there are copies available at Barnes & Noble! EDIT 3 (2:30PM EST): Whew okay guys my hands need a break - I'll be coming back and answering questions in a bit, in the meantime, check out the new episode I put out today!  submitted by /u/OliverBabish [link] [comments]
