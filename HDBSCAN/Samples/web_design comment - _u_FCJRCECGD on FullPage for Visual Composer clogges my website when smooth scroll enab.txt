/u/FCJRCECGD on FullPage for Visual Composer clogges my website when smooth scroll enabled and more.
If you had purchased that "FullPage for Visual Composer" plugin instead of getting a nulled version, you could have had the original plugin developer assist you with this issue. What if it is malware from this nulled plugin that is causing this strange behavior?
