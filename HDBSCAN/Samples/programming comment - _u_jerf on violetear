/u/jerf on violetear - The journey to achieve 0 allocations
Somehow, the Go community got stuck on the idea that it is somehow mandatory for routers to be very fast and have zero allocations, as some sort of bizarre accidental quirk of a couple of projects that did some benchmarking. While I don't necessarily want to say you should be completely unconcerned about your performance, you are almost certainly overengineering your router, and you should probably relax and go put some engineering into the portions of your web code that is actually the bottleneck (which is very very unlikely to be your routing code) rather than optimizing yet another Go router to within an inch of its life.
