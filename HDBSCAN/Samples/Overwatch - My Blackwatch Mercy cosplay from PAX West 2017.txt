My Blackwatch Mercy cosplay from PAX West 2017
Here's a link to the album. Halfway through making a genderbent Mercy cosplay I happened across this fanart by AnimatedAnarchist and decided I wanted to mix things up a bit since I was already changing the outfit to be more male. I had a ton of fun cosplaying all four days and I already have plans on how to improve the cosplay for future cons. I had a TON of people recognize it was Blackwatch Mercy which felt awesome though a lot of people assumed it was "Reaper Mercy" or "Evil Mercy". You'll also see my friend Zebidee as Shrike Ana and Sean as Nevermore Reaper. Zebi helped both of us get our cosplays built. Also, next time I definitely need a staff since I spent pretty much every photo shoot like this. PS: If any of you happen to have taken pictures of us at PAX I would love to see them.  submitted by /u/Failoe [link] [comments]
