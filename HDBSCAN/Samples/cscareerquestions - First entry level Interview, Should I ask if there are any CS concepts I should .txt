First entry level Interview, Should I ask if there are any CS concepts I should review in preparation?
I have an interview next week for a software engineering position and I really want to land this job, is it frowned upon to ask if there are any specific concepts I should review in preparation? Also, would it be weird of me to bring a page of notes to the interview so that I can remember what i want to talk about and ask the interviewer? I sometimes get really nervous and I can lose my train of thought very easily, especially if there are multiple people in a room with the spotlight on me. Lastly, any tips for a first time interviewee? I really want to nail this interview so any tips and advice would help. Thanks!!  submitted by /u/hwarfshano [link] [comments]
