/u/alinroc on Tool that shows efficiency of 2008 R2 DB/SQL configuration.
I've never used DPA so I can't comment. We had SQLSentry at a previous gig and what I loved about it is that while it had tons of analytical tools for the hardcore geeks, it also let me show non-technical and semi-technical people where the pain was. On several occasions, I was able to bring up the performance monitor graphs, zoom in to where we had people calling in complaining about system performance, then flip over to the Queries tab and and say "see that query? That's coming from process ABC being run by person XYZ and that is what pushed us off the cliff. And see where things came back to normal? That's when the process was terminated, and you can see the query isn't running anymore at that time." You don't have to know SQL Server internals to understand that when the lines go in a particular direction, bad things are happening :) The Agent job monitoring and alerting was really handy too. You can probably do similar w/ DPA, I just haven't used it so I don't know.
