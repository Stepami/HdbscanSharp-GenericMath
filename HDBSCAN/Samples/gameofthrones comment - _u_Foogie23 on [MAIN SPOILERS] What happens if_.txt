/u/Foogie23 on [MAIN SPOILERS] What happens if...
I think having any time travel or such be a part of the Mad King's story is the biggest slap in the face to fans. It completely diminishes the whole "flip a coin" philosophy and the bloodline of the Targs. Targs being insane was not an uncommon thing. This is part of the reason why Rhagaer was so amazing. Not only was he completely (well....not completely) sane, but he was a good person. Both of these qualities are against the normal Targ history of being batshit crazy. Mhagaer (spelling?) the Cruel built the Red Keep and then had EVERYBODY involved slaughtered basically red wedding style. Other Targs in history fought against each other and roasted people with dragons. The Mad King being a time travel victim bastardizes all of this.
