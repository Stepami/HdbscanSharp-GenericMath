Currently learning microsoft sql for a career in the future...
this is my first try at coding : so i was wondering.... for jobs out there, are there any other programs i should also learn to accompany my sql knowledge?(i am looking toward entering the data analyst industry) or ....if there are too many to list ...can anyone answer this... is having a background in sql enough to get a job? or where would be the best next step toward making myself a worthy candidate fora good job?  submitted by /u/northsideindian [link] [comments]
