/u/techcaleb on LPT: Whenever you are having work done on the house, always insist on being told the supplier of all the materials/parts (windows, doors, blinds, tiles etc. etc.) - when you need spares 5 years down the line, there is no guarantee your contractor will still be around to tell you.
Tile size definitely makes a big difference. I suppose I should have clarified that I recommend keeping at least 10 square feet of tile. Use is also a factor, as is the tile material (porcelain vs ceramic vs slate) because some last longer than others. Traffic patterns fall into use case. I wouldn't say a specific percentage, but if there is a heavily trafficed area, then you will need more. Also consider the cost of replacing the floor. It's large, but not usually too large. The spare tiles are just there to let you repair small damage spots. If there is anything larger, then it is probably more cost effective to just replace the whole floor instead of tearing up and replacing 7% of the floor. Another thing to consider from a designer perspective is to find creative ways to break the floor space into smaller pieces (for example, no larger than 200-500 square feet of the same flooring material). For example, adding some border tiles in, or planning half walls can reduce the cost of a replacement, and allow replacing each segment separately. Personally I think it makes the house more visually interesting as well.
