Thesis About Identification of Rice plant Diseases on Mobile
I'm currently in third year college and just started my thesis 2, and for my suggested title I went with "Rice plant Disease analyzer" i was originally planning on building the application on desktop, however upon interviewing farmers( who are the target of my app ) they told me that they prefer a mobile application instead of a desktop app. upon learning this, my team and I are now tweaking our documentation and are now planning on developing a mobile application on android instead. Now my problem here is I have zero knowledge of image processing, although I found a related literature stating techniques and algorithms I can use, I don't know where to start actually learning image processing on mobile, I tried searching online but I can't find a decent tutorial on it. if you guys and point me in the right direction, it would be very helpful. Thank you very much target language: Xamarin ( just starting to learn it too, not comfortable with android studio ) Edit : i forgot to mention that we are severely lacking time, we have until late october for this  submitted by /u/aldrin12 [link] [comments]
