Tool that shows efficiency of 2008 R2 DB/SQL configuration.
Noob post I am the help desk IT guy at a medium sized business. Our company is in the process of upgrading hardware and have tasked a couple of outside IT firms to dive into our environment and help quote out and implement a full upgrade solution for our company. Our hardware is nearing end of life and our user base has grown about 5x since the initial implementation of our current hardware/SQL/DB setup with little to no tweaking of our setup to accommodate growth. While these outside firms have found some red flags with our current configuration; we haven’t committed to them yet and don’t have the specifics on what we could do to optimize our current environment until we can do a complete upgrade. So my question is: Are there any lightweight (preferably free) tools out there that can be run without hogging too many system resources that can provide “stats” on our environment. Like average read/write times in an hour. Amount of queries executed, system memory in use, etc I just want to be more knowledgeable on our current environment and basically have solid numbers on how “heavy” our system is being used and compare that with the hardware we have to see if we can make some software changes to help with efficiency.  submitted by /u/Heyo74122 [link] [comments]
