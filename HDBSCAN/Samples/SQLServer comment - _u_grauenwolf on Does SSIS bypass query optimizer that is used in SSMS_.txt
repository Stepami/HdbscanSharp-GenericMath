/u/grauenwolf on Does SSIS bypass query optimizer that is used in SSMS?
the interviewer asked/told me that SSIS doesn't optimize queries like SSMS does.  Yes, that is possible. But probably not the way the interviewer was thinking. When you fire up SSMS, it can override the default values for a bunch of connection settings such as ANSI_NULLS or ARITH_ABORT. If it changes these so that it doesn't match the settings used by SSIS, then you'll get different execution plans. Possibly even different results. (I know this because I've seen the same problems with SSMS vs C#.) So technically yes, SSMS and SSIS don't necessarily optimize queries the same way. But as been previously said, the optimizations they do perform are still inside the database itself.
