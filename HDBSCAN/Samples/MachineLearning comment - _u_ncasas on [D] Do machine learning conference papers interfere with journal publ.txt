/u/ncasas on [D] Do machine learning conference papers interfere with journal publication
It certainly "inteferes". ICLR explicitly disallows dual submission for the conference track. This is the dual submission policy of the conference track: Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals are not allowed and violate our dual submission policy. However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peered reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have a publication proceedings) do not violate the policy. The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process period.  On the other hand, the workshop track is considered non archival, therefore you can submit the same paper to a journal.
