CNN for several images derived from microtomography. How to apply it?
I've started working on a project to classify the shape of an object by the various horizontal sections of it, acquired using microtomography. So, for each object I have a folder with hundreds of images that look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/q9pfV I have no idea how to use all those images to classify just one instance. I've played a bit with tensorflow to classify things with only one image, but I am completely lost with an array of them. I've been thinking about using video classifier, but not sure how that would workout or what algorithim to use. Do any of you know how to tackle this problem? Any kind of reference would help me tons. Thank you very very much in advance! (sorry for the poor english, not my first language)  submitted by /u/ArgNio [link] [comments]
