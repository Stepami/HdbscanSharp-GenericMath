/u/Phrohdoh on Side project in .NET Core or Java?
In subreddits dedicated to a specific language/tech/framework/etc if your answer isn't always "Our X is far greater than Y and Z" you're practically asking for downvotes (although my comment does contribute to the thread so it is quite clear people on this subreddit do not understand the use of downvotes) but obviously a ranking on the internet for a comment I made means nothing in the grand scheme of things.
