Document Classification and Satoshi Nakamoto
I haven't done much with document classification before, so I decided to get my hands dirty with an interesting problem - who is Satoshi Nakamoto? To do that, I went ahead and scraped the sites of a handful of potential candidates for Nakamoto and put together a classifier to compare his written work with theirs (all the details can be found here: https://www.datahubbs.com/can-machine-learning-unmask-satoshi-nakamoto/). I tried to lay out my method as clearly as possible because I've never worked with text before and would like to get some feedback. I tried to highlight some of the weaknesses of the analysis in the post, but I'm sure I'm missing others. I'd like to follow up and make some improvements, so any thoughts would be appreciated!  submitted by /u/hubbs5 [link] [comments]
