/u/bchris24 on Ryan Clark on Antonio Brown - "People think that he's just a hard worker who’s here to win football games. No, Antonio Brown loves Antonio Brown. He’s like most receivers. He’s selfish.”
If that happened to me, I guess I wouldn't wear his jersey anymore? I wouldn't stop rooting for the team just because one player didn't sign my shit. The fuck kind of fan is that, it's not like the entire organization pulled down my pants and laughed at my junk or something.
