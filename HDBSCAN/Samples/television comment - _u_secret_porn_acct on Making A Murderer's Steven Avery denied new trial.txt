/u/secret_porn_acct on Making A Murderer's Steven Avery denied new trial
Again, you are missing the point of innocent until proven guilty. I'm not talking about the job of a prosecutor necessarily.. Are defendants having to prove themselves innocent? No. That is a much more difficult task. If the government accused you of robbery, and the premise was guilty until proven innocent; YOU would have the burden to prove that you didn't do the crime... where as in innocent until proven guilty, the burden lies on the government to prove guilt. Also the public doesn't have to treat anyone like they are innocent. The public is the public. The cops job is to enforce the law and gather evidence... As for judges, are you really trying to make the case that judges are requiring defendants to prove themselves innocent in criminal cases? That the government can accuse someone of a crime and it is on the defendant to provide evidence of innocence..
