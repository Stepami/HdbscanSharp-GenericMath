/u/fuckinginfixation on Anyone here familiar with Document Frequency Thresholding?
It's just a fancy name for a slight, intuitive modification of TF-IDF -- "ignore words that don't show up very often in the corpus". The point of TF-IDF is to find stuff that's meaningful in a document by finding stuff that's frequent in the document but rare in the corpus. Therefore, word that appears in one document and nowhere else in the corpus will have a high TFIDF score. Imagine the reasons that this might happen: it might just be a name or a typo. You may get better results by ignoring that word and counting words that show up in the corpus at least a few times. This isn't a highly-theoretical, scientific technique, but just a fancy name for the application of a practical heuristic to TF-IDF.
