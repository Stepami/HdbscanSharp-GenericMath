How can I run a WPF application from the exe (on a different PC) without exposing the .config file
Hey guys, So I want to share a program I made with friends and all is well - I copy the .config, .exe and the .dlls from the bin folder and give them that - which works fine. The problem is that the .config file is literally the App.Config file which includes the connection strings to my database, which is not so great... They are able to see details required for my database. Could anyone tell me how this can be bypassed? I am actually clueless on what to google (I've been trying for past 30 mins or so now with no luck).  submitted by /u/remiX55 [link] [comments]
