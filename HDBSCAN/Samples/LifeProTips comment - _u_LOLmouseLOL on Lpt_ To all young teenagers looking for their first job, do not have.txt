/u/LOLmouseLOL on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
Got my first job when my mom went down to the grocery store and applied for me. I was in the store, so he asked to see me. I came over, small chat, boom had a job as we left the store. This is to say it really depends on your location and the type of person the manager is. I got lucky, admittedly.
