What does everyone think of a Financial Computing degree? What jobs would this degree possibly prepare me for?
https://imgur.com/a/VTkjf Looking for some insight into option number two. I am interested in both Finance and Computer Science and this degree seems great for that but I am worried that it will only teach me half what is necessary for both career fields, any insight would be great! Thanks!  submitted by /u/DCoop25 [link] [comments]
