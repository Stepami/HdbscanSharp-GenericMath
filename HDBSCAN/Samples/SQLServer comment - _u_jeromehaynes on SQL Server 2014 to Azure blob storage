/u/jeromehaynes on SQL Server 2014 to Azure blob storage - Picking up new databases
Hi, I know the feeling! Thanks very much...Jackpot! Everywhere else I've come across wants to reccomend me to minion backup scripts (Which is great but so much knowledge for someone who isn't a DBA to implement my head was hurting after 3 hours of trying to implement it was too much hassle) On the same point it was frustrating to have to implement something like minion backup and set all that up when the only feature I'm missing is this. There are going to be hundreds of databases being backed up on this server which will be production so you can see why I'm a little edgy on being on the safe side with this stuff! I didn't realise that you could use the changebackuptype with the backup to azure option. I mean I could see it in the sample scripts but that was to disk and I wasn't sure what coding I had to add/remove/change as I'm not familiar with SQL programming! I'll test on my server and let you know. I really do appreciate your help on this one, I knew it would be something simple! Best, Jerome Haynes
