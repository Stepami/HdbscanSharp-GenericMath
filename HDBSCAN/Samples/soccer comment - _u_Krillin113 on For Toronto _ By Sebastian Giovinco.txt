I'm not entirely sure, like I'm sure he could adapt, but I'm not sure how good he is once adapted in that roll if you catch my drift. It's a completely different beast and I have no clue how he'd manage that, and that's coming from someone who was a fan of his in his Parma days. No clue why, only player from mid table Italy I remember from these times. Maybe he destroyed Milan once in a game I watched or something.
