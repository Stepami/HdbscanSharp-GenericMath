How to get SSL certificate(s) for Email and Web Site.
I am a computer scientist and have steered clear of web development as much as possible. I have figured out how to deploy a site onto AWS using Elastic Beanstalk. I have another EC2 Instance that I am deploying an email server on using Postfix and Dovecot. I have been given plenty of guidance on those areas. Where I am lest sure is in the area of SSL certs. What are the good/cheap places to get them from that are well trusted. Can I use the same one for both the email serve an website or do they need to be two different ones.  submitted by /u/zmanalpha [link] [comments]
