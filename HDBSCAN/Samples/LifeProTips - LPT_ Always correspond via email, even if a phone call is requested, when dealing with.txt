LPT: Always correspond via email, even if a phone call is requested, when dealing with sensitive matters such as prospective employment.
Shining example of why I more or less refuse to make phone calls: I am due to go for training at the end of the month, but just received an email (requesting a phone call) this morning stating that if I didn't provide my last paystub by 2pm today, I would be pulled from the class, effectively preventing my employment with the company. When I responded, I mentioned that this matter had been taken care of weeks earlier and that there must be confusion. Seeking further inquiry and attempting to resolve the issue, I learned that the previous contact is no longer with the company as I had kindly asked the current correspondent to reach out to them regarding the matter as they might be able to confirm/deny that I did indeed provide the "required" documentation. I am now able to provide a transcript with proof regarding the matter which is saving my ass big time, however, had my previous correspondence been solely via email, I would have no evidence that I was not the guilty party regarding the matter and that there seemed to be an issue internally instead. I urge anyone and everyone to do the same! While it might seem like a pain in the ass and "inconvenient" to some who actually prefer phone calls or even a face-to-face, sometimes a paper trail, albeit an electronic one, is sometimes very valuable instead and worth the additional time and effort!  submitted by /u/th3doorMATT [link] [comments]
