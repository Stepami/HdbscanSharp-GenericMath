Is it the norm for everyone to constantly try to show how smart they are in this field?
Stuck in an open office environment, and I constantly encounter the situation where someone comes to ask me a question, and the 2 other devs around me always feel the need to listen in, and start spitting out answers/opinions before I even get a chance to process the question most times...the whole brogrammer-smarter-than-thou routine...is this the norm these days? I know it's all about teams and everyone contributing these days, but goddamn.. Edit: Clarifying a little bit - it's not the case where they join in to an ongoing discussion and add their knowledge to it - I'm all for that - it's more of the PM comes over and asks me "Can we do xyz to our existing application.." (random example), and before I can open my mouth to speak DEV #1's headphones come flying off and he answers them, then DEV #2 chimes in....30-40% of time I do end up having to correct them  submitted by /u/cscqs-throwaway [link] [comments]
