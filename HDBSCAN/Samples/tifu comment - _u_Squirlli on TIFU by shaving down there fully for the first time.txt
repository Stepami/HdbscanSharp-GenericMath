/u/Squirlli on TIFU by shaving down there fully for the first time
Get an ice pack , trust me, it will make it feel much better. Don't apply directly, make sure you have something like a cloth between the pack and your skin. Leave it for 10 to 15 min or so. Wait 20 to 30 minutes and you can use an ice pack again.
