/u/PunFuMaster on New PTR Patch doesn't give Mercy a rez cd reset after ulting anymore
Yeah, and I play all of them. I'm just annoyed that when a healer gets one buff (speaking about the GA momentum here) that make her more fun and interesting to play, then it gets nerf because the DPS player base goes "boohoo, she is difficult to hit now T.T"
