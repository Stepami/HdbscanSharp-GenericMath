Client asked for "Proof of Insurance"
I'm negotiating a contract with a company, and we're in the final stages before moving onto the actual work. Agreeing on the contract terms, signing the NDA, all that good stuff. Something they've specifically asked for is "proof of insurance", which is something I'm guessing is required by their own insurance company. I've never had that requested before, and might have to tell them that it's not standard practice for devs to have business insurance. Before doing so, I wanted to check with you all: Do you have business insurance? If so, which company and what kind of policy do you use? Is it a reasonable request for a contracting web developer to provide their own insurance policy?  submitted by /u/in_client_hell [link] [comments]
