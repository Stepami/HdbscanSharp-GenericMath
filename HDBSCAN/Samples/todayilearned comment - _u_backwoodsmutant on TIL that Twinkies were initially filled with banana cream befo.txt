/u/backwoodsmutant on TIL that Twinkies were initially filled with banana cream before WWII. When bananas were rationed due to a food shortage, the company switched to the cream filling, which turned out to be far more popular. Also, despite misconceptions, a Twinkieâ€™s shelf life is only 25 days.
Fun fact - my college roommate and I purposely left an unwrapped Twinkie on the windowsill for a semester. While it did become a stale yellow brick, there was no mold or any other sign of decay.
