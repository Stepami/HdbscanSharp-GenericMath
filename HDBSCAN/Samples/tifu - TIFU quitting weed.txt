TIFU quitting weed
So I've been a smoking (excessively) pretty much daily over the past 2 years. I really fucked up my grades last semester because I've been using it as an escape, and i was dealing with a rough breakup that ended in me breaking my hand on a fence. I know I'm fully capable of getting good grades, and I'm determined to do just that this semester. In order to do that, I've decided to cut out weed from my diet just two days ago. The past two days have been miserable, and I've barely gotten any sleep. Every time I eat i get nauseous about halfway through the meal. 3 meals the past two days have come back up, so I've resorted to snacking. If anyone has been through something similar that can help or has any advice, I'd really appreciate it. TL;DR Quit weed cold turkey after years of excessive use, dealing with what seems like withdrawal symptoms, looking for any advice to help me through this rough period  submitted by /u/edfordy7 [link] [comments]
