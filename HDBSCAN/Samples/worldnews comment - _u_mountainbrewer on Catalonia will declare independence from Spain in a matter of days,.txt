/u/mountainbrewer on Catalonia will declare independence from Spain in a matter of days, region's leader Carles Puigdemont tells the BBC
I just came from universitat barcelona (about midnight local time) and it seemed pretty normal to me (USA citizen first time in Europe).

However, I was warned by a bar tender tonight to be careful the next couple of days. That being said, I have not felt in danger since I had been here.
