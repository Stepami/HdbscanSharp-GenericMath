/u/RobRomijnders on Clustering categorical events in time series
As a simple approach, I would chunk the time series, count the events in a chunk and learn a Bernoulli mixture model on that. Probably you might intuit a good chunk size with your domain knowledge. As a more sophisticated approach, try to make a one-step prediction model. Note, this will not help you to get clusters. But you might still find it interesting to see what an algorithm would predict to come next. In that case, you could use a recurrent neural network. at every time step, you feed the event type and its attributes. The target you predict would be the type of the next event and the number of minutes of latency.
