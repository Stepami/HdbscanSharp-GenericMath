/u/twotime on Agile Software Development and Scrum - Heaven or Hell?
How are you tracking these knowledges year on year, across aggregate teams, across projects, customers, and domains?  And agile solves this problem how? By measuring velocities? Because, really, that's the only numerical metric I've heard of. Apart from agile, have a good corporate wiki, write decent project/firefighting post-mortems, And try to cultivate strong teams.. No data to confirm the veracity of those gut feelings..  The manager either can lead the group or (s)he cannot. If (s)he can, the results will be delivered on time and customers will be happy. There is this strange belief, that "bad metrics" is better than no metrics. That's not the case at all. Bad metrics will just waste your time in a short run and, even more importantly, lead you further astray in the long run That goes for counting productivity in lines of code (hmmm, what could possibly go wrong here?) or in story points (exactly the same problem)
