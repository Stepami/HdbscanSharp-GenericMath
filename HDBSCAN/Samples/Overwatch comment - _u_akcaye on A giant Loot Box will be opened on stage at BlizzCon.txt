/u/akcaye on A giant Loot Box will be opened on stage at BlizzCon
It has gone down; almost vanished. I literally never got a duplicate since that update until I depleted rares (blues), and recently I depleted the commons (greys) so a standard lootbox is always four duplicates for me now, but that's just what it is; there are no more grey and blue items I can get. But I never got a duplicate in a rarity that I hadn't depleted. Some people may have, but the odds should be insanely low. Are you sure you haven't gotten all the greys and blues (standard ones, so excluding event items)? Check your hero gallery.
