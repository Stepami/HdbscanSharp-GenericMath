Patterns in electrophysiological data
Hi guys! First post but I really hope you can help me out. I've never done any machine learning before. I'm currently just starting my PhD where I'm starting on a project where we are looking determine whether a neuron in the supplementary eye field contains information that allows us to predict whether the monkey is going to make (or has made) an error or not. The outcome I currently have coded are binary [0, error; 1, correct]. I'm starting out by using spike rates, but will be looking to use LFP and other electrophysiological data. Can anyone advise me on what may be a nice approach for this classification task? My current idea is to initially use a logistic regression and assess efficacy, and then progress to more advance classifiers, such as SVM. In a perfect world, I'd like to use something which would help to distinguish distinct differences in patterns of spike rates between error cells and reward cells. Thanks in advance! (Note: happy to use matlab, R or python; any code or resources would be incredibly appreciated!)  submitted by /u/invictusNeuro_ [link] [comments]
