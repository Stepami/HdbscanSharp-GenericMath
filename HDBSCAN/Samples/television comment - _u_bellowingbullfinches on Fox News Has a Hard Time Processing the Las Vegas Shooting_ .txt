/u/bellowingbullfinches on Fox News Has a Hard Time Processing the Las Vegas Shooting: The Daily Show
Right, there have been zero mass shootings in Australia since the buyback, and the rate of decrease in gun violence nearly doubled. Those are hard facts. It's not more complicated. You edited your comment as I was typing my reply. All of your sources either directly support my argument or are questionable (the link supporting that the US is behind in mass shootings, which is directly contradicted by your Pew Research link, and is also some random website I've never heard of that doesn't exist anymore, thus the archive link). Please see my edited reply above, where I responded to your edited comment. You've taken a hostile tone, and it's becoming increasingly clear that you will take the same position regardless of available data, which is exactly what I pointed out in my initial comment in this thread. I'm sorry that the discussion has already gotten to ad hominems, but I'm not interested in a flame war with a stranger on the internet. This will be my last comment in this thread.
