yes that females are simply just a breeding tool. You commonly hear the word 'female' being used on nature documentaries and such. In my mind applying this to women just makes us seem more like biological creatures/animals than actual sentient beings. We are just meat sockets to some men. And that's ok they can think that-they'll just ever be able to experience any lady's meat socket.
