IamA Independent songwriter/musician, who's toured the states 7 times, and I'm getting ready to release my second studio album. AMA!
**My short bio:As a New York native, I've migrated coast to coast performing my brand of indie acoustic soul, reminiscent of 70s troubadours like Bonnie Raitt and modern artists like Brandi Carlile. My song The Ender has appeared in a feature-length indie film and my song Listen My Dear was commissioned for a short film. I'm currently finishing my album set to be released this fall. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-full-length-album-from-karyn-ann/x/16919421#/ My Proof: https://twitter.com/karynannsoul/status/905457537822081024  submitted by /u/karynannsoul [link] [comments]
