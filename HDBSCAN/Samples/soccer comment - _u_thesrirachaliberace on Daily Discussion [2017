uh, no. The 5-0s are just a main stay in the other leagues because they're a testament to the talent gap in the league. The 4-0s coming out of every other United game are outstanding, and the fact that City are upping the ante makes it seem even more bizarre. The difference between what's happening in Spain, Germany, and France, and what's happening in England, is there's no method to this madness, and its less about a talent gap, and more about the fact that there's an apparent on/off switch for every team. Hence why only 7 points seperate 1st and 8th, why Liverpool won 5-0 and lost 6-0 the following game, why Arsenal was at the wrong side of that 5-0 and has been winning tight games ever since, and why City was at the right side of that 6-0 and have been thriving on the merit that Pep (and Mourinho) have a lot to prove. Things will calm down in November, as they always do, but you should probably take these blowouts with a pinch of salt, because every one of these games merely features Palace, Liverpool, and City, who are all either too good, too shit, or too much in crisis mode. I mean, the season started off with a 4-3 between Arsenal and Leicester, and the biggest loss since then has been Watford 0-6 to City, who were otherwise unbeaten in the league in spite of that blowout (3-3 vs Liverpool, 2-0 vs Bournemouth and Southampton, 2-1 vs Swansea, for context) In France, PSG pulls it off every week because they're PSG. In Spain, Barca can win the Catalan derby 5-0 and take the winning streak all the way to a 6-1 at Eibar, while Madrid's only concern is that their winning streak has turned into a frustrating unbeaten streak.
