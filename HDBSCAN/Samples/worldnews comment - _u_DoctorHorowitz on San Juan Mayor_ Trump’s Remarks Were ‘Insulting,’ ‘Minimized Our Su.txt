/u/DoctorHorowitz on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’
He could solve world hunger and cure cancer and aids and his detractors would be upset with whether he shook the right hands or kissed the right asses. It's shit on both sides. The president isn't a God. He didn't cause any hurricanes. He didn't send anyone to Vegas to shoot at crowds. Disaster relief is historically always shitty. They complained about it with Obama. They complained with Bush. They complained with Clinton. They complained with Bush and they complained with Reagan. Why? Because it's an easy complaint to make from the opposition.
