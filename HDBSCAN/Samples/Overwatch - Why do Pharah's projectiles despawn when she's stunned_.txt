Why do Pharah's projectiles despawn when she's stunned?
This has been happening for a while and it bugs the shit out of me. Pharah's projectiles are significantly slower than most hero's's', so if I fire a concussion blast at a MCree and he stuns me, the blast literally just boops out of reality and goes on cooldown. Same with Rockets. This also happens when you die which is crazy annoying when you were about to kill that guy right after he killed you and the projectile you fired dissapears into the aether. EDIT: The rockets might've been weird favor the shooter instances, hard to tell since my connection's fine, but the concussion is 100% consistent and I've been noticing it for months now.  submitted by /u/Arjahn [link] [comments]
