/u/trident042 on Non Americans, what's going on in your country that we should know about?
You... might be arguing at the wrong person. I have no desire to impose legal restriction on speech of any kind. The very foundation of language depends on it. I simply wish people to understand that the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution in no way protects them from other people having opinions about what they say. It protects them from being brought before the law on the grounds they said something the law didn't like.
