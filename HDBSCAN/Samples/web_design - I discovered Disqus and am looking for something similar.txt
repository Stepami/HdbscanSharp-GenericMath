I discovered Disqus and am looking for something similar
I'm looking into building a forum site for my home town. I love Reddit's comment system and as far as I know Disqus offers the kind of comment system I want. I have just a little programming knowledge but it should possible to build a simple site by using templates and plugins like this, and I'm willing to pay for the service they offer like Divus. I want to code as little as possible when I create this site. I'm clueless here on how to let the visters sign up and post on my site. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/BigBlueBawls [link] [comments]
