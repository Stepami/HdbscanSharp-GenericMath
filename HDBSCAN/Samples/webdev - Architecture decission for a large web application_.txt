Architecture decission for a large web application.
I am the lead developer and architect on a large web application. We currently store very sensitive data as double encrypted blobs in an Oracle DB. We run role based security around all these objects and are running into technical issues with backups and upgrades. Would it be best to move these files to something like Filenet or Disk or create a new DB to support only this application. We have many applications running on this DB. The other option is to move the 6 or so tables that regulate doc storage to a new DB but then I will need to deal with DB links and the loss of RI. Right now I am leaning towards migrating this large application off of this DB entirely and create a new DB on it's own LPAR. Any thoughts?  submitted by /u/Rounder007 [link] [comments]
