/u/groce21210 on Canadian here. People around the world. Who are your favorite Canadian bands/musicians and why?
I love Half Moon Run, they have a wonderful soft, sad sound to them, while also sounding kind of upbeat. I love them. Edit: also, Arcade Fire. For similar reasons to Half Moon Run, but also that I always like to whistle along to their music.
