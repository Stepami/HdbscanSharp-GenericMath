/u/americaneejit on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
Former assistant manager of a movie theater (so lots of teenagers), here. I was always impressed with the kids that brought in their applications rather than the parents that filled it out for their kids and spoke to me on their behalf. You could tell who actually wanted a job and who was being forced to work.
