Should I major in computers if I suck at math but have a great background and understanding with computers
So basically I'm not the smartest kid but I'm about average. Everything but math and computers. I suck at math really bad and quite frankly I hate it unless I understand it. On the other hand I've been building computers since I was 10, (built over 21), I've fixed countless computers for my friends and family, I have taken AP computer science 1, computer science, and about to take AP computer science 2 my senior year. I know my way around programming and I'm very knowledgeable about computers in general and usually referred as "Tech support friend". I've fixed iPhones and other phones countless times for my friends etc, basically I'm a tech guy and it's my dream to pursue computer related major in college like a software engineer or anything computer related really. But since I've always struggled with math I have always been hesitant to go through with it even though I do average to above average in my actually computer science classes. But I'm taking a very easy math course for my senior year. I would love any input as college major decision is upon me quite soon. Edit: just wanted to say thank you for all your responses they really helped me a lot.  submitted by /u/Childiish_ [link] [comments]
