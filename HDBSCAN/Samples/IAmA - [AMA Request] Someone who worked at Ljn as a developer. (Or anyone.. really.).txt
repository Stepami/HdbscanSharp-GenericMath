[AMA Request] Someone who worked at Ljn as a developer. (Or anyone.. really.)
My 5 Questions: Did you know most of your games were shitty? Did you have any harsh deadlines to meet for shitty games? How was your work environment? While testing your games, did anyone notice how bad some of your games were? How the hell did you drive the car in Who framed Roger Rabbit?
