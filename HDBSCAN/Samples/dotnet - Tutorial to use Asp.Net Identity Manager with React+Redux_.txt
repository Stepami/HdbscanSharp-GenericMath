Tutorial to use Asp.Net Identity Manager with React+Redux?
I've been bashing my head against a wall trying to figure out how to do this for the past few days. I tried following this tutorial: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1185880/ASP-NET-Core-WebAPI-secured-using-OAuth-Client-Cre Everything was going great until I hit the line: "Reference to type 'AuthenticationOptions' claims it is defined in 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication', but it could not be found" So the reason for that is obviously not working is because it's not supported in Asp.Net Core 2. No matter, I mean even if I used OAuth2 I still need to use the Asp.Net identity system to identify users and since I want to have sers signing up for the site directly anyway I can always integrate an OAuth2 method of doing it. So I followed this tutorial (partially) to add Asp.Net identity users: http://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/b957238b-e2dd-4401-bfd7-f0b8d984786d.aspx Everything was going great, I was able to create accounts, use the sign in manager to sign in (and it was succeeding with correct users, users were populating the users table too, yay!) but then came the time to have a user login and do actions a logged in user can do. So I found subsequent API calls calling signinmanager.issignedin was returning false. I'm not sure why that happened, I read something about adding cookies to track authentications. Unfortunately I'm not sure how to follow that or how it applies (found no tutorials or even particularly helpful documentation on this). Can anyone help me out here?  submitted by /u/yixue [link] [comments]
