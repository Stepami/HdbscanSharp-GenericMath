LPT - Follow up Verbal agreements with a friendly email casually noting important aspects of the agreement
In situations where someone influential in your life (like an employer) offers something verbally, you must be carefull not to offend by "asking for it in writing". Most professional people will not have a problem with this but I'm losing a little faith lately in professionals; so as an alternative, and something I have found very helpful on many occasions is to follow up with an email that covers the important aspects of the agreement but posed in way that you are simply following up and that you will post updates as necessary. Here is an example: Mr./Mrs Boss, As per our discussion today, I am excited to get started on that [project/task name] and do not see any issues having it completed by [date], I would also like to thank you again for the opportunity and the extra $2000 this will provide for me and my family. I will keep you apprised of any relevant issues concerning this project. Have a nice day -Bob  submitted by /u/Textipulator [link] [comments]
