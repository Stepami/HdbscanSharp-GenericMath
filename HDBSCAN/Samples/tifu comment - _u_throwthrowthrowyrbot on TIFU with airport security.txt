/u/throwthrowthrowyrbot on TIFU with airport security
A friend of mine looks dark and vaguely middle eastern (he's also been told Indian, Mexican, and several asian countries) and he gets "randomly" screened every time he travels alone. He's learned to show up super duper early so he doesn't end up missing his flights. It's made him dread air travel.
