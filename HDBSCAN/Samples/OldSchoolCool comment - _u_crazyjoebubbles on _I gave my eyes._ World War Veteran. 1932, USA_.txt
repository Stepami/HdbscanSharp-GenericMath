I think about this a little bit each day, I'm wondering if it's the slow trickle of dopamine from the interesting things that I'm getting from the daily infusion of internet-related media and news and YouTube and Google and everything Tech related and what the internet gives me nonstop. Because when the internet wasn't in my face in the 90s? I lived life with normal human beings interacted with them every day it was real emotion outside physical touch sights and sounds. The only thing I had was the TV pretty much and a cell phone a shity one (2003). I'm just wondering if this slow adaptation to the internet and all that it offers is somehow ripping the soul and emotion and life from me? Just something to think about. I'm really 100% contemplating giving up everything that the internet has to offer. Cell phone, computers, every single thing. The only thing I want is to use it at work, and once that's done come home to go outside and talk to real people and live in the real world completely devoid of anything Tech related to do it all. Then when I come home I'll watch TV and maybe play a couple of games on my Xbox. I don't want this shit anymore I want to have memories and real love and emotions again like I did in the 90s and early 2000s.
