/u/Brendoshi on Lucio: PTR vs Current
I still find it weird that I can never once get the super launch by clicking twice (once to jump, once to jump off the wall) but can 100% of the time doing it with 3 clicks (once to jump, twice when I jump off the wall) or with a scroll wheel. Hopefully blizzard can fix it either way, so people are happy again.
