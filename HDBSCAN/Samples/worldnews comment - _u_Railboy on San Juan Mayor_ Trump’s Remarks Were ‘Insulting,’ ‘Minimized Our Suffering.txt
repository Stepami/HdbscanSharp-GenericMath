/u/Railboy on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’
I've noticed that when Trump does something so indefensible that even his hardcore followers begin to doubt his fitness to serve, that's when they really put their backs into defending his actions. My pet theory is that they're cultivating outrage to soothe their doubt. In their minds, the more upset non-supporters are, the more 'right' Trump is. So by venturing outside their cave and collectively encouraging non-supporters to talk down to them, they reassure themselves that yes, Trump was right yet again. Because how could anything that angers people they despise be wrong? It's messed up.
