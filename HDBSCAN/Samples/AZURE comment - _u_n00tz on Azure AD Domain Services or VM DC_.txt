/u/n00tz on Azure AD Domain Services or VM DC?
Isn't that Azure AD Domain Services price ON TOP of the price for Azure AD Premium (required for Azure AD Domain Services)? They change this stuff up often enough that I don't try to keep track of it until it's time to engineer the solution for a client. Edit: also, This might help you recognize the correct scenario quicker than asking reddit. Edit2: it appears as though I was wrong about the requirement for Azure AD Premium.
