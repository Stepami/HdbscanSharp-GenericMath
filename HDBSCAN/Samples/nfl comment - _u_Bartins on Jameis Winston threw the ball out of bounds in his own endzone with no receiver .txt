/u/Bartins on Jameis Winston threw the ball out of bounds in his own endzone with no receiver in the area. Should have resulted in a safety.
The ball went directly over the receivers head so that picture is extremely misleading. That it was uncatchable and 20 feet over the receivers head doesn't matter because the grounding rule is stupid.
