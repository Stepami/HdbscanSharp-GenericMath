/u/J3STER_58 on Overwatch main to personality survey
I noticed on the test that you placed the "Flex or Other" option within the Overwatch main question where you choose one option. Could you can make being a flex player become an additional or "select all that apply" option, as I do identify having a main and being able to flex between heros.
