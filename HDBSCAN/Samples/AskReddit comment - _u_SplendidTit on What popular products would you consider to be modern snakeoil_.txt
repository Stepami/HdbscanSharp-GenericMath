/u/SplendidTit on What popular products would you consider to be modern snakeoil?
I went through my teen years and early 20s during the "low fat" craze. We ate low fat everything - cookies, yogurt, fake butters, etc. I started gaining weight but was always hungry (what a shocker, now thinking about a diet that was sugared up, with no fats for satiety). My doctors doubled down - no fats! No fat at all! Every time I used anything but skimmed milk, or ate anything but skinless chicken breast, I was made to feel like I was getting fat and killing myself on purpose. I eat pretty balanced now, but I can't escape that anxiety when I eat something with fat in it.
