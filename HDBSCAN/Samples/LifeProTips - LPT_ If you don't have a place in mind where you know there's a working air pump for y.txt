LPT: If you don't have a place in mind where you know there's a working air pump for your car tires, any Firestone will fill them up for free.
My air pressure light came on in my car, and I went to at least five gas stations only to find that the air pumps at each of them were out of order. I drove up to the nearest tire place, a Firestone, and asked for help. They told me any Firestone will fill up your car tires for free. I'm never going gas station hopping for an air pump again!  submitted by /u/Idekyo [link] [comments]
