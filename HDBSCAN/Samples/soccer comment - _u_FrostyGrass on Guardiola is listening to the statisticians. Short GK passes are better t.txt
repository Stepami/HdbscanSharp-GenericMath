/u/FrostyGrass on Guardiola is listening to the statisticians. Short GK passes are better than long ones.
I wouldn't say he is listening to them, Pep has always had goalkeepers short pass out the back. All the way back with Barcelona he was playing out of the back with risky short passes instead of long balls because of the benefit of wearing out the opposition and drawing them deep. So it's more that his play style requires short passes than him listening to statisticians.
