/u/masterpharos on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’
This is a serious question I assume? Because you're too slow to work it out yourself or you're being purposefully dense for the sake of protectionism of trumps ego from a distance? Either way, it matters because as head of state you are held to account by the media, by the public and by other nations. Behaviour and actions that do not appear sensitive or appropriate in context will be seized upon as opportunities to question your stability, professional attitude and competency. We expect our head of state to be able to display those in all situations. Trump can't do any of them. He fumes on Twitter, he fumes at press conferences, autofellates at crisis meetings and is strangely unable to hand people paper towels to people instead of throw it at them. It's not a game. Image matters. Don't be so fucking dense.
