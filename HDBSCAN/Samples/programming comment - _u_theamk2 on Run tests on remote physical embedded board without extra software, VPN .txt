/u/theamk2 on Run tests on remote physical embedded board without extra software, VPN or SSH. It Simply Works!
"without extra software"? PlatformIO is an extra software, and as far as software goes, it is pretty big. Also, given that PlatformIO is designed for low-end CPUs (like arduinos), of course is it will not have VPN or SSH -- the target systems are too small to support it. However, it does use "avrdude" and "openocd" which is usually used with those kinds of CPUs. That said, it is a pity the blog post is so light on technical details. If I run my unit test on an Arduino, will it re-flash it with unit test code? What about FLASH memory wear? Should there be a warning to always attach a testing-only board when you want to run a test command?
