/u/Moon_ire on Using reshaped lists as input for conv2D
here's what i did to make it work normaly :  data = [(0.1,0.5,0.31),(0.01,1,0.57).... ] RGBs = [] for i in data : RGBs.append(int(i[0]*255),int(i[1]*255),int(i[2]*255))  and then used a putpixel methode so i could get png files that i used as input in tensorflow (usual deal)  tf.cast(tf.reshape(image,shape=[64,64,3]),dtype=tf.float32)/255.0  but as you can see the int(i*255) looses my decimal point precision, which is really sensitive in this case. so i hoped to find a way to directly implement the data as if it was a bunch of normalized rgb points to the con2d layer.
