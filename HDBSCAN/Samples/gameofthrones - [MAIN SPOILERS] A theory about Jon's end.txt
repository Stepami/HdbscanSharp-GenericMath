[MAIN SPOILERS] A theory about Jon's end
In the books, Beric passes the flame of life into Catelyn Stark, giving his life for hers. I think there's a good chance that this foreshadows the ending of Dany and Jon's story. Dany will die somehow-or-other (White Walkers? Assassination? Undead Viserion? Who knows!), and Jon will pass the flame of life into her. Jon will die (sob!), and Dany will live to rule the Seven Kingdoms, with her and Jon's child as her heir. Just my little theory (and I'm sure I'm not the first to come up with it). Kinda hope I'm wrong, would love to see those crazy kids live happily ever after - but, let's face it, that probably ain't happening. :(  submitted by /u/crookshanks_ [link] [comments]
