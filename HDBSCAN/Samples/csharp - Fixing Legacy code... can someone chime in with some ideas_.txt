Fixing Legacy code... can someone chime in with some ideas.
Novice Here, and pasting in the current code is difficult enough but would only serve to confuse everyone. (This simple thing is currently broken into 8 different places.) So i will just try to explain. I have an MVC project, and I am generating a list of items that the users need to address. (Changing the source of data from an overly complex wcf to a webApi) All these items are personnel that are having changes made to them for HR, I am also trying to retain the front end as much as possible, because they don't want any visual changes. The problem. In this method the HR person in charge of making changes would select the person that the personnel being edited will report to. To achieve this currently, In each item in the list contains an array of every single person that is currently employed to choose from in a drop down. This is 3000+ users, with thousands of other variables attached to them... It seems rather inefficient... as once you select one of them, the rest are forgotten and only the single user is saved. I have not messed with razor views much at all so this is all new to me, but I want to know if there is a way for me to just generate a single list of all users, and use that list in the dropdown, Once the user is selected I want to make an API call to attach the single person to the record. I do not know enough about what I am asking to know how to search google for an answer, So if I could just get some keywords or a link to something to learn from that would be great. Also if my idea of a separate list is wrong, If you have a better idea to still give the HR person a list of 3000+ names, but where I don't need to add them for every item, that would also be helpful. I should also add this current idea works... as long as there is only 1 change to be made, once there are 2+ the list grows too long and breaks for going over a 60k limit.  submitted by /u/Ryusaikou [link] [comments]
