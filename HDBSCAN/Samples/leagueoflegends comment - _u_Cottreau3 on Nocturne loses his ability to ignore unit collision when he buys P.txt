/u/Cottreau3 on Nocturne loses his ability to ignore unit collision when he buys Phantom Dancer
Normal champion = unit collision. Nocturne = unit collision - unit collision = 0. Phantom dancer = - unit collision Nocturne + phantom dancer = 0 - unit collision = - unit collision. Unit collision is absolute. Therefor: Nocturne + phantom dancer = unit collision. Seems like it's working as intended to me...
