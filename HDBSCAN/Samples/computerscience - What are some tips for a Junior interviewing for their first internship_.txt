What are some tips for a Junior interviewing for their first internship?
Hey if anyone has experience of going through this process please tell me everything that you went through, my technical interview date is in 2 weeks and I want to go prepared. This is for a consulting group that requires a top level government security clearance that they are sponsoring for. So with all of that What should I wear? What should I bring? there are more questions but I can't think of them off of the top of my head lol (Also Junior in college) XD  submitted by /u/CompMath [link] [comments]
