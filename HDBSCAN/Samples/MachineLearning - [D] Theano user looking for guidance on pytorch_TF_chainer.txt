[D] Theano user looking for guidance on pytorch/TF/chainer
I'm currently a theano user but I guess I will have to migrate soon to one of the other frameworks. I really like the symbolic math aspect of theano and prefer to code up my networks "from scratch". I often have my own bespoke architectures so pre-baked "layers", optimizers, etc.. generally get in my way (though its nice to have the option of course). I checked out the pytorch tutorial (and it seems cool, particularly the dynamic graph part) but they seem to jump straight into using the neuralnetwork part of the library. Can anyone point me to sample implementation of NN architectures in pytorch, TF, chainer that do not use the high-level NN parts of the library i.e. the equivalent of implementing a GRU or LSTM in theano using scan. Also if one of these libraries is particularly not suited to this kind of approach it would be helpful to know that. Thanks in advance for any help! p.s. reposted because I forgot the tag!  submitted by /u/spurious_recollectio [link] [comments]
