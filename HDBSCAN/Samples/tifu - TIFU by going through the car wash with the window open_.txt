TIFU by going through the car wash with the window open.
Happened about 10 minutes ago. Went to go through a car wash and the machine said in a lady voice to pull through slowly. I closed my window, started to go, then heard a man's voice. So I reopened my window and said "what?", thinking it was an attendant inside. When I didn't get a response, I continued pulling forward before closing my window all the way. The water jet things started pounding my car before I closed it and soaked me and the inside of my car. As I was furiously closing my window, I heard the man's voice again telling me it was clear to pull in... I continued my car wash (with the window now closed) and laughed at myself because I'm a moron. Got home a few minutes later, grabbed some towels, and dried off all that I could. I don't think there's any damage, except maybe to my ego. TL;DR: I needed a shower so I decided to open my window in the car wash.  submitted by /u/ChicagoMay [link] [comments]
