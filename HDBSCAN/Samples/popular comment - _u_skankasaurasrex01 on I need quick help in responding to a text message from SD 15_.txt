/u/skankasaurasrex01 on I need quick help in responding to a text message from SD 15.
Uh yup, pretty sure. I notice your name quite frequently on this sub as it seems as if you have quite a lot of spare time to dedicate to telling people how they should step-parent. You have a very aged perspective - and that's fine and must work quite well with older step-children and adult children. I go out of my way to avoid interaction with you. That's how poisonous I find your commentary. I know that might not mean much to you, but I'm sure that you enjoy validation for your outdated perspective. I can also say that my parents tried to "shut things down" for me too and it backfired into an unhealthy relationship with my parents. And I know a lot of people feel the same way about theirs. You're coincidentally close in age to my own father and hearing you speak solidifies my opinion that you are just an older individual with a very narrow perspective. I choose to live my life providing perspective and respect to my step kids and I've received nothing but in return from them. Kids are kids are kids and they will always behave in the way that they are cognitively capable of behaving. I'm not saying to not guidance and discipline when necessary but I can firmly say that "shutting things down" in the way you are suggesting is a really poor way of parenting. Interactions with you are why I avoid posting on this sub and quite frankly, I'm disappointed that you're a mod. Maybe if you spent less time commenting on here and more time nurturing your relationship with your DH and your SK's, you'd have a much smoother home life and wouldn't complain so much about them.
