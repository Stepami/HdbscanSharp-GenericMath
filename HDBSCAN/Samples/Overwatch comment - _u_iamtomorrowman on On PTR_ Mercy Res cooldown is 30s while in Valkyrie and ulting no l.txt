/u/iamtomorrowman on On PTR: Mercy Res cooldown is 30s while in Valkyrie and ulting no longer resets CDs (Gif)
i'm disagreeing but i wasn't clear so i apologize for that. Valkyrie is now fine, imo, pending playtesting. her res is not going anywhere, but since it's no longer attached to her ult in the design, this is a step up from her previous iteration.
