/u/Platypus211 on TIFU: By taking my daughters to the park
Something similar happened when I was a kid, I think 5th grade. I kept missing the bus in the mornings so my parents finally made me walk to school. It was about 2 miles, so my dad followed me in the car the first time to make sure I didn't get lost or do anything stupid. Two different women pulled over to make sure I was ok and that the sketchy looking guy following me was my dad. If cell phones were as common then as they are now, someone probably would have called the cops. I remember thinking it was kind of nice that people actually gave enough of a shit to stop and check.
