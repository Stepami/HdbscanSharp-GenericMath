/u/Johnnyallstar on What is the best example of a player being dominant against another team over a period of time?
I never said he didn't. But the fact that we haven't had a QB win more games at home is an indictment on the Browns ability to find a sustainable answer. Big Ben has 10 wins in Cleveland. That's a lot for a visiting QB, but not many for the home guy. If we had a starting QB that just went .500 for 3 years at home, he would have the record. That's saying how bad we have been finding a QB.
