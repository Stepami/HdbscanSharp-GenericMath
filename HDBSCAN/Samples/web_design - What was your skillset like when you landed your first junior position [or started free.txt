What was your skillset like when you landed your first junior position [or started freelancing successfully]?
Hi all, I am entering a classic post-college quarter life crisis. I have no career at the moment to be honest, but wanted to go into front-end development/design (I'm kind of bummed that it seems you have to heavily lean one way or the other in the real world) but I don't have any marketable skills yet. I just have side gigs creating child themes for $100 here and there, etc. I already have a solid base in CSS and some JS (mostly jquery), mostly creating child themes. I don't know sass or any frameworks which I'm assuming are definitely needed. I also don't really know standard project management skills and workflow so I pretty much always wing that and I don't know anything about version control. In fact I don't really think I know what version control is. Those are the skills I know I need to learn, but I worry there are skills I don't know I need to learn. So here are my questions: 1) What skills are essential to learn to land a real job? 2) do you really have to pick between a purely design or purely dev position or are there any places that look for someone to do both? 3) Are most jobs at firms these days, or can people still freelance successfully? Also, do freelancers tend to offer both design and development services simultaneously? 4) Can all these skills be self-taught or are there any that you highly recommend a course for?  submitted by /u/inexplicability_ [link] [comments]
