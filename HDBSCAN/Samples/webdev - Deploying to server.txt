Deploying to server
Hey guys, I am still relatively new to web development, so please go easy on me. I started using Git a short while ago to manage the versioning of my projects and found that it's also great for working on multiple machines. One of the projects im working on runs on a server at work. I have command line access, but am not in the sudoers list. The server does not have Git installed. Currently I am zipping the project, wgetting it and extracting it to the root folder of the project on the server. It works, but it doesn't offer a seamless transition because I am: first removing/backing up existing files  having to chmod some of the newly extracted directories   What's the best way to deploy changes in the project, to the live environment? Many thanks,  submitted by /u/Super-administrator [link] [comments]
