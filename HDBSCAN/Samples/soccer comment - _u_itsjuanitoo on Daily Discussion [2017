This thread about atleti not allowing Barcelona fans in the stadium because of the obvious issues in politics is full of people who have no clue about the situation. I really can't believe people are blaming and getting mad at atleti when they're doing the right thing to prevent potential violence to Barca fans. you can really tell most of the Barca fans on here have no clue about Catalonia or Spain, just from reading that thread.
