/u/boilernos on Making A Murderer's Steven Avery denied new trial
This is completely wrong. Don't listen to him. Mark Fuhrman used the n word a few times in a screen play and was painted by the defense as a racist. He had World War Two memorabilia that was German. The job was on the prosecution to show the jury this was irrelevant. Blood samples, constant lies in interrogation, suicide notes, low speed chase should have way out weighed the fact that Fuhrman said the n wore a few times. Also, instead of having it tried in Brentwood they had it tried in LA. Right after watts riots, king, race wars.
