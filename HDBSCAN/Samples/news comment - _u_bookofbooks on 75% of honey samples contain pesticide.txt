/u/bookofbooks on 75% of honey samples contain pesticide
This is the same argument as people should be thinking of when they say stop using pesticides. Do you think Nature is going to not devour a field of delicious food just because we put it there? Even organic farmers use pesticides, and they use ones which are arguably worse in many ways. The only alternative currently would be to have people out in those fields killing insects by hand. In such a scenario, my preference would be that it be the people opposed to pesticides usage.
