Junkrat ALWAYS dealt a lot of damage
"Oh, but he has 2 mines that deal 120dmg each, it's a OHK" It's actually a 2 hit kill, and after the first, you'll be sent flying away from Junkrat, you surely has the time and possibility to fight back. And oh, believe me, Junkrat is fragile as fuck. Only once in a blue moon will he hold onto his two mines to nuke someone instead of mobility. Another thing: Junkrat plays EXACTLY like the old Junkrat but with an ultimate that isn't utterly garbage. The only difference is that once in a while he'll have a two mine burst, usually at the beggining of the teamfights, because he can't be saving his two mines all the time, mobility is his forte right now. So y'all ain't mad about Junk being OP, you're mad because he plays exactly like before but you don't like his playstyle. Guess what, I hate Pharah too but I don't demand nerfs. Why don't you try switching to her if Junk is pissing you off instead of crying for nerfs? Seriously.  submitted by /u/benevapwnz [link] [comments]
