"What would ResNet Do?" - What Hardware and threading was used by the ResNet-50 team that won the ImageNet competition in 2015?
Hi all, I have read all the articles but I can't find the specific hardware used by the ResNet-50 team when they won LSRVC 2015 with ResNet-50. I would like to know: 1) What GPU's they used? 2) How many? 3) How they threaded them - One copy on each GPU, or one layer per GPU? 4) The hardware requirements 5) And finally, the training time they needed for the results. I have read through their paper, but I can only find the hardware for when they compared it to CIFAR-10 which was only 50K training images... Can anyone help me source the hardware requirements for replicating ResNet-50 training with ImageNet?  submitted by /u/WhatWouldResNetDo [link] [comments]
