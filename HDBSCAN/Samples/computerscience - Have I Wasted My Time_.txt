Have I Wasted My Time?
I just felt the need to type this out since it has been bothering me for some time now. I am a computer science student currently attending university. I am a senior and I will be graduating this coming May. And I am, absolutely, terrified of looking for a job. I feel as though it's a lack of confidence in myself. Simply put, I don't feel like I have learned the things that I should know for my future work. Don't take me wrong, I love computers, specifically programming. I just feel like there is little nitty gritty technical stuff that I'm missing. I feel as though I have a strong basis for programming, but that's about it. I don't know if it is my fault or my institution's, who's to say? You may ask what my grades are. And I'll tell you even though I feel like I haven't learned that much, I have never received below a B in any of my college courses, plenty of As as well. I am also a mathematics student, pursuing two bachelor degrees. Overall, I just don't feel confident. I feel as though I'm going to be asked a question in an interview that any fresh grad should know but I'll draw a blank. Any advice? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/Raging_Gamer14 [link] [comments]
