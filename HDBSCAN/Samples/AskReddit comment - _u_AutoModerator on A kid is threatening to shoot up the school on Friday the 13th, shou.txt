PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE TAKING ACTION. Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: Rule 3: Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?" Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  Rule 1: You must post a clear and direct question in the title.   If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to contact the mods. Thank you. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
