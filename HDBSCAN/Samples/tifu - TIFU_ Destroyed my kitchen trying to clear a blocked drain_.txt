TIFU: Destroyed my kitchen trying to clear a blocked drain.
Was cleaning my kitchen, filled up the dish washer and hand-washing a few things that didn't fit. It was draining very slowly. So I added some caustic once it dropped to the plug level and did other things for a bit. The dishwasher drained and the caustic went into the sink. I have one of those black plastic/molded resin/whatever sinks, so I start freaking out as it cant be in contact. I bail out the sink, and pull the p/u trap so I can drain the water, and make the expect mess, catch most of it, but still a mess. I clean that up and rinse the sink down into a bucket. Cant tell at this point if its fucked or if it'll clean off, looks fucked. I have one of those tools that connects to a garden hose, goes in the pipe, expands to seal it and uses water pressure to break up/push out clogs. I get it running. Go outside to check the inspection port, can see it starting to run/clear. Go back inside and out a few times making sure it isn't leaking hasn't come off. Water came out my wall aircon, same wall as the sink, but much higher. I have no choice and turn the hose off. The bladder deflates and dumps a bunch of water on me as on on my knees turning the valve off at the time. Flooding the kitchen. The block must have been bad enough that the water went up the vent pipe. So I must have a bunch of water in my wall/ceiling too. While this went on my cat shit in the bathtub. Hopefully insurance are sympathetic, I don't think its unreasonable to try and deal with a blocked sink. AH call out for a plumber starts at about $500 where I am. (this was at night) TL;DR. Diy sometimes goes bad.  submitted by /u/fist4j [link] [comments]
