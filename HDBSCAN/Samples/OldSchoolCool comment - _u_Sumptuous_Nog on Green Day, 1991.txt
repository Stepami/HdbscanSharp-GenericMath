/u/Sumptuous_Nog on Green Day, 1991
People are entitled to their own opinions, but Green Day was dope in 1991 and they are dope now. Not every release has been a hit (looking at you Uno, Dos, and Tre), but personally I have fallen in love with at least a few tracks tracks on every album from Dookie to Revolution Radio. I'm looking forward to whatever album the band eventually puts out in response to our current political shitshow.
