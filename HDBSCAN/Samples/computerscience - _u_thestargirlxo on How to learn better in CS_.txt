/u/thestargirlxo on How to learn better in CS?
I'm glad you asked. I'm retaking CS II and Calc II. (might become a sophomore again omg) But I'm also taking Theory of Computation and currently learning about DFAs they are a little annoying to draw. I'm also taking Artificial intelligence and Chem II(pretty easy). CS II shouldn't be too difficult, but towards the end of the course we learn about stacks and queues and that is slightly challenging for me. Calc has never been my strong suit, but I'm not letting it scare me.
