/u/SerDickonManwoody on Russia just helped North Korea harden its nuclear arsenal against US cyberattacks
We are all free to have our opinions.  And your own facts? Hah :) Russia is independent country and just like US or any other country have it's own long term goals and it's own geopolitical view.  All is fair in love and war, so we must examine how the peace is kept. I don’t see Putin respecting the rights and liberties of his people. The two nations are not even close to morally equal. It's not like Russia invented "proxy wars" US is engaged in them as much as Russia or even more.  Same as above. Who does Putin choose? He chooses Kim Jong. He chooses Bashir. Russia also chose Saddam. Baathists and Cult Leaders. I’ll pass, and others should too.
