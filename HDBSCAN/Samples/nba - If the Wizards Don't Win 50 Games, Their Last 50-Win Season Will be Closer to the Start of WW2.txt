If the Wizards Don't Win 50 Games, Their Last 50-Win Season Will be Closer to the Start of WW2 than Present Day
The Wizards own an ongoing record of futility and mediocrity that might end up outliving even DiMaggio's 56-game streak. Specifically, the most seasons played without winning 50 games. Since 2000, every NBA team has won 50+ games at least once, except for the Wizards and Hornets. Notably, the Hornets didn't even exist for part of that time, yet even Charlotte last saw a 50-win team in the 1997-98 season, when Tim Duncan made First-Team All-NBA. The last time Washington won 50 games, in contrast, that First-Team All-NBA spot was occupied by Elvin Hayes: the 1978-79 NBA season. From the 1968 through 78 seasons, Washington won 50+ games five times. And in 1977, they only won 44 games, but they also won their only title. From there . . . 40 years of downhill. In fact, 1978 wasn't just the last time Washington won 50 games; it was the last time Washington even made the Conference Finals. Specifically, Washington's last 50th win was on March 25, 1979, a 116-107 win over the Pistons. Box Score Accordingly, if the Wizards don't win 50 games this year, they'll go until at least the 2018-19 season, meaning that they will go at least 40 years between 50-game wins. The Second World War began on September 1, 1939 with Hitler's invasion of Poland, which was 39 years, 6 months, and 12 days before the Wizards' 50th win in 1979. HowLongAgo Thus, if the Wizards fall short this year, on September 11, 2018, it will have been 39 years, 6 months, and 13 days since the Wizards last won 50, and that 50th win in 1979 will be closer in time to Hitler invading Poland than to present day.
