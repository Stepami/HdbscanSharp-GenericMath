LPT REQUEST: How can I help adult daughter with OCD/anxiety issues about North Korea?
My exquisitely intelligent 27-year-old daughter has had OCD and anxiety since puberty. She's a UC grad who works in San Francisco and lives in Oakland, which means she has to either take BART under the bay or take a bus over it. She is daily pummeled by news of North Korean missiles that escalates exponentially. Kim has said one of his targets is San Francisco. She takes Zoloft (sertraline) to help manage her symptoms and it helps tremendously. Sometimes, though, world events (like crazy dictators and a sword-rattling president) push her over the edge. She can talk about it reasonably, mostly, but has had some severe panic attacks. If she were your child, what would you say to comfort her? I'm not looking for advice on therapy, meds, etc., as we are experts in those areas. ARE we in true danger? Do you think US defenses are adequate?  submitted by /u/kellysmom01 [link] [comments]
