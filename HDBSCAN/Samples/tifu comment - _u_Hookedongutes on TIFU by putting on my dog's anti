/u/Hookedongutes on TIFU by putting on my dog's anti-bark collar
Ha! Depends on the dog. My Labrador's parents busted through an electric fence. It won't stop his parents, it won't stop him. He wears a shock collar for his barking. He's determined and we've already had a ticket for his barking. And he barks for no reason. Sorry, bud. He also wears a pincher collar on walks. Yes I love my dog. Yes he is obedient. And they're effective tools when used properly. Bark collar is on lowest setting, pinch collar keeps my big dog from choking himself and from dragging me in his younger prime.
