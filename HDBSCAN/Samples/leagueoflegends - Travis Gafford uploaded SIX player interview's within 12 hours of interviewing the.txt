Travis Gafford uploaded SIX player interview's within 12 hours of interviewing them.
I thought it was pretty impressive that Travis was able to interview 6 different players and then upload every interview for Day 1 of Group Stage before Day 2 even started. So glad that Travis was able to go to worlds, his content is always informative and entertaining. Definitely looking forward to the upcoming interviews.  submitted by /u/MatureNade [link] [comments]
