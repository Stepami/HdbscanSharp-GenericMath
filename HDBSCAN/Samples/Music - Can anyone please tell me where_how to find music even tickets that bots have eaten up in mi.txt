Can anyone please tell me where/how to find music even tickets that bots have eaten up in minutes please?
I was really excited to get my ticket for Fall Out Boy's 'Mania' show in London this coming January, but literally minutes after the ticket sales opened up, it was sold out - I basically had no chance. I was hoping someone on here might have some ideas on where I might find these bot-eaten tickets being re-sold online? My only other option is to watch ticketmaster daily, in the hopes they release more tickets... Any and all help and advice welcome - thankyou! :)  submitted by /u/BondiHipster91 [link] [comments]
