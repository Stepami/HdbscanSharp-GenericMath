/u/run7b on [Discussion] I'm an undergraduate in CS and just entered my final year. I have an idea for a final year project in computer vision. I want to achieve a top grade in this but I'm afraid I don't have enough knowledge to do so. What do you recommend?
The pose estimation and action recognition project you linked to is interesting. The authors (3 PhD's) were able to determine whether a person was reading a book or writing on a clipboard in real world video in real time. I have done pose estimation in optimized video, and its not that hard. What about something similar to this, except with soccer? Don't worry about your supervisor's, 'under the hood,' comment. With supervision, pick a project that has a narrow enough focus that it only requires specialization in one or two aspects of CS. It's fine to use established and tested libraries without knowing how they work, as long as that is not the focus of your project.
