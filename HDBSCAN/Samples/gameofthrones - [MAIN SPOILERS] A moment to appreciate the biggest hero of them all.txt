[MAIN SPOILERS] A moment to appreciate the biggest hero of them all
Ser Davos is the savior of mankind. When Jon was betrayed, he made the difference - Jon's brothers in the watch that stayed loyal to him did so out of their duty and oaths. Ghost loves Jon. Melisandre was just about ready to try anybody out for the role of Azor Ahai. Not our Onion Knight. He could have shirked off into the night and nobody would have noticed. He risked his life and turned to somebody he hated to save Jon. He goes on to do the right thing time and again. He contextualises and accepts Tyrion was only doing his job at the Blackwater when he killed his sons - a trait many people in Westeros have trouble doing. He goes back for Gendry, putting himself at the risk of Cersei and Dany's wrath. All hail the Onion Knight. Edit: The beautiful bastard has only gone and got this high up the GOT page too. In thanksgiving, here's a fantastic music video he features in: https://youtu.be/E4povfmX144  submitted by /u/the_messer [link] [comments]
