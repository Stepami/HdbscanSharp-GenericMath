/u/BlindWillieJohnson on Kyle Shanahan on not naming starters besides Hoyer and Staley: "I don't mean to be a dick."
First of all, the 9ers are a legendary franchise. And I always hate it when those dwell in the toilet. I like to see them good enough that upstarts like us can take some pride in eating them. Second, Seattle's not going anywhere anytime soon. It's good to have someone in the division to challenge them. And as short lived as it was, the Carrol/Harbaugh rivalry produced some of my favorite games and I miss it.
