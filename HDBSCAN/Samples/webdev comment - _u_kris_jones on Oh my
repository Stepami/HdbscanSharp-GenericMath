/u/kris_jones on Oh my - Dropbox has a new design... it's a bit... different.
I’m surprised that people are surprised. This style has been bubbling up for over a year and it was only a matter of time until a big company used it. All the justification for flat design “focus on the content”, “UI design has matured”, “CLEAN!” Are all memes. They’re not true. When you internalize them as truths, you get angry when they are betrayed. The flat era obsession with cleanliness has run its course. It wasn’t correct. It was just another trend. It tricked people into thinking we reached some sort of end point. You will get used to it. People are reacting to this the same way they reacted to ios7: “omg every app is white!”
