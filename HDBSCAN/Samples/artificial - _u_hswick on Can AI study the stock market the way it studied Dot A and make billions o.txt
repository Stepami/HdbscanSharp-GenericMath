/u/hswick on Can AI study the stock market the way it studied Dot A and make billions overnight?
Unfortunately stock market data is very stochastic and lacks structure, especially long term. The most you could say is that it is fractal in nature. You can look at Mandelbrot's work on this. People do use neural nets to do short term trading otherwise known as high frequency trading. I'm going to assume what you meant by self learning as reinforcement learning. Which would actually be more complicated than needed, because the steps with trading is simply buy low sell high. So a simple supervised model would suffice. If you are interested, look up time series regression with machine learning
