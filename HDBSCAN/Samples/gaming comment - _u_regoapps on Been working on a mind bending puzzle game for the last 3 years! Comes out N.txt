/u/regoapps on Been working on a mind bending puzzle game for the last 3 years! Comes out Nov 3
Oh man... I really feel for you. When I started the first year of app development, I was the same way to my GF. App development just excited me. It's all I wanted to talk about and all I wanted to do. My GF was sick of hearing about it. When we went to Hawaii together, I would sneak in time to look at my phone and play with my apps. I felt guilty about being on vacation. I wanted to be home and working, because I knew that each day I waited, was another day of lost revenue. I was living in the basement of my mom's house as well and had a full time job at Columbia University. I had too little free time for my GF, but I did give her whatever spare time I had. The amount of work eventually stressed me out to the point that my personality started changing. Needless to say, we broke up. I've learned my lesson, though. Now my app development takes a back seat to my SO (if I had one, been single for a year now). I hope it works out for you two. It's also going to be devastating if the app fails, you might have to deal with a sad/disappointed boyfriend for a while. That also happened to me, and I remember being all depressed. And that was over an app that I only spent a month on. I can't imagine how depressed I'd be if an app I spent 3 years on failed.
