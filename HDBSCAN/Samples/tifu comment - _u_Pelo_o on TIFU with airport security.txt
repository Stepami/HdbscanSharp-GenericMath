/u/Pelo_o on TIFU with airport security
Yeah, being a "joker" isn't fun at airports. A security guard jokingly asked if I had any bombs on me, and I laughed and said yeah just a small one in my laptop. They scanned my laptop 4 times, and even opened bottom of it to see the contents. Surprisingly, no bombs! Almost missed my flight :D
