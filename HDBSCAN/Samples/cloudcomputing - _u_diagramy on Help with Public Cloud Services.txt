/u/diagramy on Help with Public Cloud Services
Here are a few thoughts about the major providers: AWS - They've been around the longest and are considered to have the most market share of any of the major cloud computing providers. Being around the longest has enabled them to generally have the most services and features. I say generally because the other cloud providers offer unique services and features to differentiate themselves. AWS has the richest ecosystem of partners, meaning that there are more consulting practices, ISVs, etc that work with AWS. They can be amongst the lowest cost if you take advantage of their different pricing options. Edit: However, their pricing options are confusing and difficult to manage. Google - They don't have as broad a service offering as AWS yet. However, they are successfully differentiating in a couple areas. First, they have some better features than AWS in key areas. Their VMs start faster. Their load balancers generally scale easier/faster than AWS'. They have strong big data and machine learning services (I won't say they're necessarily better than AWS, just have different strengths for different use cases). Their network services are also considered strong against AWS. Second, they have better pricing options. They do per second billing for VMs. They have auto price reductions if you keep the VMs running. MSFT - They are closest to AWS in terms of breadth of offering. They have tight integration with their existing MSFT products. So if you're a MSFT shop, there will likely be some beneficial integrations. Out of the three major cloud providers they have the most problems with reliability (IMO). Ali - Not sure SAP - Not sure
