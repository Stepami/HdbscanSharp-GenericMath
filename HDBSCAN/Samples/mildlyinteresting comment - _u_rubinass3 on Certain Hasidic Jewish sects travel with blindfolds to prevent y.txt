/u/rubinass3 on Certain Hasidic Jewish sects travel with blindfolds to prevent young men from seeing immodestly clad women
You say that as if it's possible not to make such judgements. I'm fact, it sounds like you feel that way about me (that your understanding of behavior is somehow better). Whether or not that makes you a better person or not is semantics. The fact is, as a society, we feel like there is some behavior which unreasonable and even dangerous. There's no reason to accept such behavior unconditionally. It seems silly that if we don't accept unreasonable behavior that we would then label ourselves as "beneath" those we call out. It seems that if we're making judgements, it's fair to say we would be above. But, honestly, who cares? Your seem to think that there is something wrong with that. It's not really the point, though.
