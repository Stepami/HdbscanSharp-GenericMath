/u/Pablo647 on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
If your parents can get you a decent internship so by the time you graduate college you can get an even better job then why not? Of course AFTER graduating college don't use your parents...
