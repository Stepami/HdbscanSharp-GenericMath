The 2017 Suns finished the season with 1,854 3PAs, good for 28th in the league this season. 1,854 3PAs is also good enough to land them in the top 100 All-Time for 3PAs by a single team in NBA History.
Sorry for such a bulky title, but this is just astonishing to me. They finish 28th in the league this season, but still land in the top 100 all time. To give some perspective, 3's have been around since 1980 (37 years) and we'll say over that span there have been an average of 25 teams in the league each year (1980=22 teams; 2017=30 teams). This means there are approximately 925 other qualifying teams, and thrusts the Suns into the top 11% all time in terms of 3's attempted, and they finished near the bottom of the league this season. I don't really care if this isn't well received, just thought the internet is too big for this not to be out there somewhere in the realm.
