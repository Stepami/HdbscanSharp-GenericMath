NUMA/CPU issue with Poweredge R810 & SQL 2014
We have two R810's in our Disaster Relief center for backup SQL nodes in case our office goes down. Both have 4x Xeon E7-4830's and 64GB of DDR3. One server (lets refer to it as Server A) has Node Interleaving enabled in BIOS and shows 4 NUMA nodes. Server B also has Node Interleaving enabled in BIOS, but through Powershell, the machine shows a single NUMA node and the graph mode in Task Manager shows the 'NUMA Nodes' as greyed out. Server B only allows SQL to use up to 50% of the CPU, while A can get to 100%. Any advice would be very helpful.  submitted by /u/sulax2007 [link] [comments]
