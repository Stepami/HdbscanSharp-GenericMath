/u/trevorjwelch on All That Is Needed To Be A Great Website Designer
Logged in just to say how bad this website's design is. The nav bar has text that changes size on-hover which shifts everything down and makes everything hard to click. The header is not even aligned to the top. The whole page doesn't seem to follow the same design choices and looks like everything was shoved together. There are more social sharing options than I've ever known about. Who is going to add this article to their Amazon Wishlist? There are many of their icons that haven't seemed to load, their chat bot is extremely distracting, this whole thing is poorly designed, yet they are trying to tell us how to be a great designer as well as offering us their services. I'd at least write this article on a website that was actually well designed.
