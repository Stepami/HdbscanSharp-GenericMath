/u/Rorynne on What are the chances that a child has a legitimate medical condition that prevents him/her from recieving vaccines?
if a child has HIV or a similar immune system illness. or if they have had severe reactions to vaccines in the past. I know of one person who had such a severe allergic reaction that they actually became measurable brain damaged. Apparently it was a 1 in a million kind of thing but as a result it was no longer safe to give her any vaccines
