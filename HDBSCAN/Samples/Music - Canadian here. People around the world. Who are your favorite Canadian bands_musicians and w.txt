Canadian here. People around the world. Who are your favorite Canadian bands/musicians and why?
Was just biking listening to a Canadian mix I put together and I started wondering if people from around the world were aware of some of the great musicians we have here in Canada. It's okay to say you hate Celine Dion and Nickelback. We do to. But aside from that who do you guys like from here? How did you start listening to them?  submitted by /u/allfamiliesarepsycho [link] [comments]
