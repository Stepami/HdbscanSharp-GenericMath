/u/IcecreamDave on If we allowed people to adopt tigers as pets, we'd probably save the tiger population while getting our own population under control at the same time.
The ecosystem doesn't give a shit about a lot of animals. The oryx went extinct in the wild because it lived in the sahara. After it was gone pretty much nothing changed, its was still as sandy wasteland. The tiger is endangered because in its ecosystem it is a flawed species. It is built to be the apex predator, but it no longer is, we are. A fallen apex predator is destined for extinction, that nature. They try and kill humans, but humans can kill them better. If tigers became extinct in the wild the world would not suffer, it would move on like nothing happened. Hell, the world would be better off without tigers mauling villagers. If your pet tiger mauls you it's because you are a dumbass, unlike the villagers. Tigers will always exist on private property because they are valuable. Contained ecosystems are built where the tiger can live as if it was in nature, without threatening anyone. Every once and awhile an older tiger gets shot rather than starving or sickness, and their ecosystem is carefully maintained. There is always enough food for them, because land owners won't let their expensive animals die, and they will live much healthier lives in a controlled environment. I'm not talking about zoos here either, but hunting ranches. Where they have plenty of land to roam and food to eat. It is better to contain wild animals than it is to leave them to the elements. Humans can protect them, maintain them. Mother nature doesn't give a shit, it just keeps on trucking.
