Which site model to use for a history website? Total n00b
I write about local history and set up a site a bunch of years ago on Blogger, back when everything was blog-this and blog-that. Just a template and I tweaked the code with my rudimentary knowledge. I've ignored it for the last couple years because it's kind of embarrassing, but I'd like to rebuild it now. Anyway, here's my question: My only design experience is through the blog format. But is there a better way to lay out a site? I'd love to find some resources that might help explain different site models and their uses. Do they exist? Obligatory Forgive my shameful ignorance, also I'm super hungry right now so I sound even dumber, a thousand pardons.  submitted by /u/littlest_ginger [link] [comments]
