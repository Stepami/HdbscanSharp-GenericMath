/u/[deleted] on Is Alibaba Cloud a series competitor in the cloud computing space?
Then you're seeing things from the rosy-Microsoft lenses. One, Google is getting the same not "enterprise-ready" label that AWS got a few years ago. It's largely bullshit as AWS proved it to be, and a minor factor. The only threat that Azure gives to AWS is having a large enterprise customer base already existing, and as you mention, then locking those guys in with their enterprise agreements on what remains quite a licensing model and throwing in free/discounted cloud credits. From a technology perspective, AWS isn't at all threatened by Azure. That's where Google comes in, not because of enterprise software (G Suite's market share is still pretty tiny). Google has the best technology, AWS makes the best use of their technology. Once Google puts it together, they'd be a no doubt better option. Niche players are irrelevant. The big 3 aren't taking each other's market share for the most part, they are winning new business because the cloud market is so under-penetrated. Niche providers are therefore not a concern, and will not and do not have the resources to compete on that kind of scale. The ones that create new innovative services will more often than not get acquired by one of the big 3. And Alibaba? A regional cloud infrastructure provider? See Rackspace for the direction of that kind of market, only Alibaba has a better chance of surviving if they stay in Asia because of the difficulties of the China market.
