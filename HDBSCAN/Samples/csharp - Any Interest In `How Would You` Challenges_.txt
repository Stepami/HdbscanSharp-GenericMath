Any Interest In `How Would You` Challenges?
I sometimes find myself wanting to code something that's conceptually easy but difficult to model in C#. I follow up experimenting to see how close I can get to implementing a solution, no matter how hacky or weird it is. The goal isn't to make something good, but to come up with out-of-the-box solutions and learn something interesting in the process. I was wondering if there'd be interest in How Would You challenges. I'd figure solutions wouldn't need to be full projects, but rather explanations and code snippets.   Examples:   How would you implement something like shapes in C# 7.0?    How would you create a way to mimic Java-style enum values?    How would you, given an arbitrary set of convertible classes, create a dynamic conversion chain that allowed the following:  ArbitraryImperialUnit a = new ArbitraryImperialUnit(someValue);   ArbitraryMetricUnit b = a;   Any interest? Any ideas of your own?  submitted by /u/form_d_k [link] [comments]
