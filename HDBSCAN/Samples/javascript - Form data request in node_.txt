Form data request in node?
Hello, I have something like this:                                                                    Shop Online   That I need to work in node's request module. I have this:   const options = { url: 'https://store.elexausa.com/storefront.aspx', form: { FIRST_NAME: req.body.first_name, LAST_NAME: req.body.last_name, EMAIL: req.body.email, ADDRESS_LABEL: null, ADDRESS1: req.body.address1, ADDRESS2: req.body.address2, CITY: req.body.city, POSTAL_CODE: req.body.zip, PHONE: req.body.phone, PASSWORD: req.body.password, COUNTRY: "US", ADDRESS_TYPE: '0', PRIMARY_SHIP: '0', PRIMARY_BILL: '0', MAILING_LIST: '1', ReplyURL: 'http://localhost:3000/api/reply', Mode: 'Reply-Only' }, headers: { 'Content-Type' : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0' }, method: 'POST' } r.post(options, (err, req, body) => { if (err) { console.log(err) } else { console.log(body) } })  but this request returns html. How can I get it to do what I need? I've been troubleshooting this for too long :-/  submitted by /u/quesurfin [link] [comments]
