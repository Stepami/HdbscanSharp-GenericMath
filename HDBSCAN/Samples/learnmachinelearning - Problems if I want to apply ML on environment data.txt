Problems if I want to apply ML on environment data
Recently I want to apply ML on air pollution forecasting, PM 2.5. However, air pollution problem not only affected by metageography factor, but also relative to human activities, such as traffics, manufacture...etc. And human effect is not easy to take into consideration. I have search for paper and journals, but most of them seems didn't consider human's effect, which only apply metageography features. (ex. Apply deep neural network with climate data) I wonder if this is OK to go on forecasting like this? That I don't consider the human's effect, only the environment feature? Neural network is a black box, I'm afraid I would ultimately come up with a precise result, but still don't know the Know-How. Thanks for helping!  submitted by /u/Laurence-Lin [link] [comments]
