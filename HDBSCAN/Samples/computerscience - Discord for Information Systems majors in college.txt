Discord for Information Systems majors in college
If you’re an Information Systems major in college, feel free to join this discord chat. Doesn’t matter where you go, and you can have just recently graduated. You are more than welcome to share this link with any of your peers as well. Literally just started it today. Great networking opportunity to meet others who will be in your career field but not necessarily in your own community. I have also created a datascience tab in the channel for specific questions and discussion of datasciencey stuff :) I hope to create a thriving community of IS majors and data enthusiasts alike. https://discord.gg/k2TJZP  submitted by /u/Xilc [link] [comments]
