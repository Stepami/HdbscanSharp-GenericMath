What is 'featuresets'? Can someone ELI5 please?
I am trying to learn NLP with python on my own and now I feel I have been stuck and frustrated. Wherever I go, I will read the code about featuresets, from blogs or youtube tutorials on NLP. But they never really explain what it is and why it's important. What is it really? I don't usually use it and there hasn't been any problem so far. Usually I do the preprocessing stuff with NLTK then put the data straight to TfIdfVectorizer, then put it in a classifier. It works fine and I get my accuracy just fine. But now I bump into a case where my accuracy is really low and I wonder if not using this 'featuresets' is what causes it. What is the difference between having 'featuresets' and not? I hope this is clear enough, but if it is not, please tell me and I will edit the question. Thanks!  submitted by /u/eggman-or-walrus [link] [comments]
