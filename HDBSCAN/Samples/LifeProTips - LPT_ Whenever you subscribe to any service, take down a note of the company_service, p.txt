LPT: Whenever you subscribe to any service, take down a note of the company/service, price, and billing date. This prevents you from forgetting about a service you don't use while still being charged for it.
It's also good to strike through any cancelled subscriptions. As well as saving money that could be lost on a service you never use and have forgotten about, it also makes it easier to manage a budget, keep track of just how much you are spending a month on subscriptions and can help you narrow down mysterious charges on your account.  submitted by /u/SwishSwishDeath [link] [comments]
