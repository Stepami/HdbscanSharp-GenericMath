/u/rosxjun on Reddit, what did you get wrongly blamed for and what ended up happening?
I visited my grandma one time when I was 6 and since it was in the hill country she had this business selling firewood that was advertised outside her home. I was in the living room when a man just walked in (thinking it was a store?) and asked me about it, literally right when that happened my grandma walked in and saw this. It definitely did not look good for me. She got after me in front of this man asking why I let him in her house? The dude didn't even chime in or anything...and she sent me in the back. Ugh. Nothing ended up happening. but it ruined my day just the first of many of being blamed for something I didn't do.
