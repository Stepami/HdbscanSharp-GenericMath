Apologies if it didn't come across correctly. We're ok with missions asking you to play SR, as it's the main mode of our game. We're less ok with asking you to play ARAM without giving you an alternative. This is why the OR missions are such a promising feature. We can say "Get 10 kills on SR or Get 30 kills on ARAM" for example. And as I mentioned in an above comment, future events will be allowing Co-Op vs AI. :)
