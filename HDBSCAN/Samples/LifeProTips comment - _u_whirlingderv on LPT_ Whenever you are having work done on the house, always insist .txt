/u/whirlingderv on LPT: Whenever you are having work done on the house, always insist on being told the supplier of all the materials/parts (windows, doors, blinds, tiles etc. etc.) - when you need spares 5 years down the line, there is no guarantee your contractor will still be around to tell you.
May be worthwhile to ask for an extra bundle of shingles, depending on cost, I would think. I'd do the same with tile installs and hardwood or laminate flooring. To me it is worth a little extra money up front to know that if, years down the road, someone cracks a tile, or a door frame leaks and damages a bit of your wood flooring, or some kind of roof repair requires a few replaced shingles, that you can match it exactly and don't have to try to get close enough, or replace the whole thing. Would definitely be less then your insurance deductible for a total replacement in case your materials have been discontinued.
