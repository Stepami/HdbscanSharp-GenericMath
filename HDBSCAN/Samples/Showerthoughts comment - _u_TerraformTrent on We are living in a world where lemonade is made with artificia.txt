/u/TerraformTrent on We are living in a world where lemonade is made with artificial flavors and furniture polish is made with real lemons.
Lemons are pretty nutritious, and contain many vitamins and nutrients not found in normal, unmodified water. The sugar added to lemonade to make it tolerable isn't the best thing to be drinking, sure, but I still believe lemonade has a place as a relatively healthy drink. Water is healthy too, but it doesn't really have that vitamin C, you know?
