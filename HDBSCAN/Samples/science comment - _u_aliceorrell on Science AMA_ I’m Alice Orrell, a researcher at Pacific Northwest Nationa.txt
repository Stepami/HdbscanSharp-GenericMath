Three key factors create a good distributed wind market: wind resource, policy, and cost of electricity. The best market for distributed wind is where the wind resource is strong, the cost of electricity your system would displace is high, and your jurisdiction has favorable wind energy policies (i.e., incentives, net metering, streamlined interconnection standards). Many people want to put wind turbines, both vertical-axis and horizontal-axis, in urban, or built, environments, and on rooftops because of the visibility. Installing a wind turbine is synonymous with 'going green.' But it is challenging to accurately estimate the wind resource in a built environment. Houses and trees can obstruct wind flow and cause turbulence. Now think about large buildings and urban infrastructure. You can try to model the wind flow around a building or on a rooftop, but it is expensive and still does not provide a dependable estimate. There are just too many variables. Then, because of the unknown resource and the turbulent environment, these turbine installations typically underperform. And they are more expensive to install. It is generally not recommended to put turbines – horizontal axis or vertical axis - on rooftops or in built environments. You want tall towers in areas free of obstructions so you can generate cost-effective energy reliably.
