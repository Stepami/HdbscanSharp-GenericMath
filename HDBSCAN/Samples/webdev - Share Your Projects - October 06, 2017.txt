Share Your Projects - October 06, 2017
Create something? Let's see it! Feedback Requestors Please use the following format URL: Purpose: Technologies Used: Feedback Requested: (e.g. general, usability, code review, or specific element) Comments:  Post your site along with your stack and technologies used and receive feedback from the community. Please refrain from just posting a link and instead give us a bit of a background about your creation. Feel free to request general feedback or specify feedback in a certain area like user experience, usability, design, or code review. Feedback Providers Please post constructive feedback. Simply saying, "That's good" or "That's bad" is useless feedback. Explain why. Consider providing concrete feedback about the problem rather than the solution. Saying, "get rid of red buttons" doesn't explain the problem. Saying "your site's success message being red makes me think it's an error" provides the problem. From there, suggest solutions. Be specific. Vague feedback rarely helps. Again, focus on why. Always be respectful  Template Markup **URL**: **Purpose**: **Technologies Used**: **Feedback Requested**: **Comments**:  submitted by /u/AutoModerator [link] [comments]
