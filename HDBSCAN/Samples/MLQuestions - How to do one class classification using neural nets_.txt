How to do one class classification using neural nets?
Hello I have a mathematical understanding of fully connected neural networks, but have no real idea about how to start the project I have in mind: one class classification using neural nets I have a set of 128 keypoints describing an object (object A). I'd like to train a neural net to be able to tell me whether yes or no based on the keypoints I passed to it, it is object A. In other words it is a one class classification problem. I mainly use sklearn in Python or eventually tensorflow if that's more suited. so far I have the dataset, ie 200 matrices (containing the 128 keypoints each) I extracted from 200 pictures. Could some people help me on how to get started? I haven't found anything in sklearn about one class classification with neural nets. So far I was thinking about having an input layer of 128 neurons, 1 hidden layer of 128 neurons as well and 1 neuron in the output neuron which uses an activation function telling me how sure it is about whether the keypoints I passed to it describe object A. what I have in mind: https://imgur.com/hoOCzF0 EDIT: another approach I was thinking about was trying to detect whether the keypoints I pass to the net are outliers or not. Some sort of RANSAC approach.  submitted by /u/technicalQuestion22 [link] [comments]
