/u/Levelsixxx on A landscaper's 'hire American' plan ended with bringing in Mexican workers to finish the job
Itâ€™s funny because the people who support illegal immigration/not enforcing immigration laws/sanctuary cities are actually advocating for basically enslaving Mexicans at sub par wages, increasing cross border sex trafficking, increased drug trafficking, rape ( something like 80% of female border crosses are raped on the way), and undercutting the american worker. Then They want a fifteen dollar minimum wage, ostensively to help American workers, while they also want to import third worlders who will work for below the current minimum wage, costing these Americans jobs whom they are trying to help with said minimum wage. What?!?!?!
