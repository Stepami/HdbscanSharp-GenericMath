AppNexus Engineering Summer Intern Experiences
Hey all, I don't know if this is talked about a lot however I really want to get an internship at AppNexus over the summer and I find it really hard to get some tips and interview experience about the whole process (not a lot of resources online). This will be the very first interview of a company that I am passionate about applying to and I don't want to mess it up. Here is what I want to know: What are the stages of the interview? (How many? What does the phone interview include? What do the university interviews, on-site interviews include)  What topics do I need to make sure to study? (Will Basic DS and Algorithm suffice or should I practice graphs and such)  (I want to gauge how hard the interview is compared to Big 4 or Financial Banking companies such as Bank of America, JPMorgan & Chase or fintech companies such as Bloomberg) How are the interview questions(for the technical)? Are they an easy-medium on HackerRank or LeetCode or Medium? What kind of questions do they ask such as System Design questions, Caches? What do they emphasize their questions on?  Lastly, How was your experience like as an intern? I wanna know all about it, Thanks so much I truly appreciate it    submitted by /u/breindy [link] [comments]
