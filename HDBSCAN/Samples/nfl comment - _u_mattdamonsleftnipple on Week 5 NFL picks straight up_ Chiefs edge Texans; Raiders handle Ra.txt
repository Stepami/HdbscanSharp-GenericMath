/u/mattdamonsleftnipple on Week 5 NFL picks straight up: Chiefs edge Texans; Raiders handle Ravens
I think people are fooled by the Broncos going into prevent D/zone the last 6 minutes of the Raiders game and making Manuel look good (and he still threw a pick). EJ sucks and the Ravens will probably get 2 pick sixes on him.
