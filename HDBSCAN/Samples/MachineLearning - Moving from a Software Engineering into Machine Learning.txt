Moving from a Software Engineering into Machine Learning
I'm a Software Engineer with a Masters Degree in Computer Science and Electronics. I have lately taken an interest in machine learning and have begun teaching myself the basics. Is this possible with self study to land a machine learning role? Maybe if I enter competitions to demonstrate my competency? Or will I have to look into doing a PHD/machine learning degree?  submitted by /u/sjrj0707 [link] [comments]
