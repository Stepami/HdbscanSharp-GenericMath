Yes. Waging war against the US is treason. Fuck your rights if you want to wage war against the US you're an enemy combatant not a citizen. Oh you're not actually an enemy combatant because you don't wear insignia or uniforms. So you're in a grey zone. Oh well. Maybe next time people will think twice before giving material support to an organization bent on destroying our country and our way of life
