/u/littleoctagon on A Single Dose of Intravenous Ketamine rapidly and significantly reduced suicidal thoughts in depressed patients with suicidal ideation, a systematic review and meta-analysis shows (The American Journal of Psychiatry)
I commented above and wanted to say that the study I took part in was to gain fda approval for the use of ketamine in emergency room settings. Imagine a person constantly trying to hurt themselves coming into the ER with injuries. You could sedate them but the risk they may wake and continue is real, whereas ketamine takes the suicidal thoughts out of the persons mind completely. For how long? Well, that's where I was when I was hospitalized for about a month. I remember telling my doc that the ketamine was kinda like what I called a "pedal/coast" effect: the first day I took it, I was fine for about 24 hours, three days later I took it again and I felt okay for maybe a little more time. After 4 weeks of this, I felt good for months. After talking with my current shrink, he seemed to think I might benefit with a once or twice monthly maintenance dose, coupled with my regular meds. Anyway, take this as you will. It really really helped me. That first night, after it wore off ("trip" lasts about 2-4 hours), I could fall asleep without thinking constant thoughts of hurting myself. That was amazing.
