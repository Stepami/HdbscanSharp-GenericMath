/u/Leftys-Wheelchair on HTC Off the Map: Lustboy
I've been so hyped for Worlds today... I had no idea I'd get hit with such an emotional rock. I didn't realize I missed him on the rift this much. At least with Dyrus, Brother Turtle, and OddOne we can still watch them stream during the week. Thank you Regi for bringing him back, even if it's temporary.
