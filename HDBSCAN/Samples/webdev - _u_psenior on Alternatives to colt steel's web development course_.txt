/u/psenior on Alternatives to colt steel's web development course?
Sorry to hear about your serious health problems. My 18 year old son also has health issues that are keeping him from attending college. I have the Colt Steele course on Udemy and would gladly gift it to you. Send me a PM and I'll try these instructions to get the course to you (https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229231187-Gift-a-Course). In the meantime, below are some links that may be good sources of free training to you: https://lambdaschool.com/ (actually not free but you don't pay until you get a job) https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb/videos https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas https://teachyourselfcs.com/ http://deliberate-software.com/page/training/ (general good advice from a dev) http://upskillcourses.com/p/essential-web-developer-course
