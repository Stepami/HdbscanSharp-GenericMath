/u/xdude69 on How to improve.
Check out Danyon Togia on youtube, great game analysis n stuff, you can always learn something. You can also watch yamatocannon on youtube, he has few vids on how to improve and all that. I think the best way to improve is to record your own gameplay and analyse it. Im D5 :(, but ye it helped me alot to improve
