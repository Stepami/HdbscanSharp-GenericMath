/u/taejim on Concatanate Data in SQL
I'm hoping this isn't homework, but you can do something like this. It depends on whether your inputs are numbers or varchars currently, and how you want to handle non-numbers. The first example includes the non-numbers, while the latter excludes them. Note how things change - converting 12.5 by adding "00" to the end results in 12.500, which doesn't do anything, while converting to a number and multiplying by 100 results in 1250.00 which is also not quite right. If you care about decimals, you might need to do some further thinking.  CREATE TABLE #Numbers (a varchar(20)) INSERT INTO #Numbers (a) VALUES ('2'),('23'),('-12'),('Cheese'),('7'),('NotANumber'),('12.5') SELECT a, ISNUMERIC(a), CASE WHEN ISNUMERIC(a) = 1 THEN a + '00' ELSE a END AS StringAddAsVarchar, CASE WHEN ISNUMERIC(a) = 1 THEN CONVERT(varchar(20), CONVERT(decimal(18,7), a) * 100) ELSE a END AS NumberAddAsVarchar FROM #Numbers SELECT a, ISNUMERIC(a), CONVERT(decimal, a + '00') StringAddAsDecimal, CONVERT(decimal(18,7), a) * 100 AS NumberAddAsDecimal FROM #Numbers WHERE ISNUMERIC(a) = 1 DROP TABLE #Numbers
