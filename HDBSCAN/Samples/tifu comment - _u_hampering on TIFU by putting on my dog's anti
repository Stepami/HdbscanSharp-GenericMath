/u/hampering on TIFU by putting on my dog's anti-bark collar
Who cares about the neighbors? Call your local code enforcement person and ask what the rule is for barking dogs. Around here it's 30 minutes of continuous barking. If that's not an option, considering teaching your dogs a command to bark and a command to be quiet. But seriously, tell those damn neighbors to mind their own business.
