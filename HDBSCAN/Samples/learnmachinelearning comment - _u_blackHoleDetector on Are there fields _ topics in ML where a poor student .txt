/u/blackHoleDetector on Are there fields / topics in ML where a poor student can work on without access to clusters and multiple GPUs?
The neural network API, Keras, is both CPU and GPU compatible. You can train more complex models, including CNNs, with only a CPU, but it will require smaller batches of data and a longer amount of time to train. I have a Deep Learning with Keras playlist on YouTube here if you decide to go the Keras route and need a resource for getting started. @blkHoleDetector | YouTube
