I'm Mayor John Henry Berry of D'Lo, MS, population 456 and star of the reality show, Small Town, Big Mayor. AMA!
I have a 95-point plan to restore my small town of Dâ€™Lo, Mississippi to its former glory. If a Mayor wants to get things done in a town of just 456 people, it means wearing many hats like Lifeguard, Critter Control, Dept of Sanitation, 4H Weapons Instructor, Sunday School Teacher, Volunteer Firefighter, Dog (and Goat) Catcher, Field Crew, Tree Trimmer, and star of reality show, Small Town, Big Mayor on UPtv. http://uptv.com/shows/small-town-big-mayor/ I'll be starting at 1pm ET, so ask away, Reddit. PROOF: https://imgur.com/a/ixKH3 Thanks for your questions, everyone. It has been an absolute pleasure spending time with you within the walls of Reddit. Please watch the season 1 finale of my show, Small Town, Big Mayor, tonight at 9:30pm ET/6:30pm PT on UP TV. If you have any desire to talk to me some more, you can find me live on Facebook tonight at 8:30pm ET/5:30pm PT at https://www.facebook.com/UPtv/  submitted by /u/mayorberry [link] [comments]
