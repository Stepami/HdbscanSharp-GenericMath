I'm looking for examples of a complex website...
My company is looking to create a website that allows clients to import images of different sizes, designs and colors and resize them, modify them with certain preset modifications and combine them all together to help visualize what a "(Red Coat) with a (Blue Lapel) would look like with (Short Sleeves) and the (Short Sleeves) have a (Lightning Bolt Design) stitched into the side." I'm someone in the periphery of this project and I'm certainly not very experienced with web design... but as far as I can tell this is ridiculously ambitious and perhaps not even feasible idea. We've been in web design hell for apparently over a year now (with two different companies) and at this point I don't have faith that the expectations of our company match with the limitations of technology. Any thoughts, advice or examples of this sort of website would be greatly appreciated. At this point we're talking about just going down the route of desktop software that our clients would have to install, but the nature of our industry makes it so that they would have to download new images/designs from our catalog often. So yeah I'm just posting this in the hopes that someone is familiar with this sort of thing. Thanks.  submitted by /u/Yousaidthat [link] [comments]
