SQLCmd - Very odd issue with it treating the command line it has a line break
Buddy called me with a SQLcmd Question that stumped me. Here is the command line being run.  SQLCMD -E -S SOMESERVER\SOMEINSTANCE -Q "Backup Database [databaseName] to Disk='E:\database.bak';"  Here is the output.  SQLcmd: '-Q Backup Database [databaseName] to Disk='E:\database.bak';"' : unexpected argument. Enter '-?' for help  I had him change it to a lower -q  SQLCMD -E -S SOMESERVER\SOMEINSTANCE -q "Backup Database [databaseName] to Disk='E:\database.bak';"  and the output was  SQLcmd: 'Database [databaseName] to Disk='E:\database.bak';"' : unexpected argument. Enter '-?' for help  Totally bizarre.  submitted by /u/Thriven [link] [comments]
