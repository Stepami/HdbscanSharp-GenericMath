/u/borkborkborko on The scale of Londonâ€™s air pollution crisis was laid bare on Wednesday, with new figures showing that every person in the capital is breathing air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles, PM2.5, with most areas exceeding levels by at least 50%.
What was argued was that Europe's pollution is worse than that of the US. He tried to substantiate that position by citing two out of millions of pollutants where the US happens to have stronger regulations on. Completely irrelevant to the conversation and his insistence on those two metrics instead of talking about the picture as a whole is misleading and quite silly. One should note that it is not the case - as people in this thread want to claim - that the US wants to protect the air or water. The US is faring better on these two metrics than Europe because the regulations on these two pollutants was literally put in place as an entry barrier against European car manufacturers. In the meantime, the US is the clearly worse polluter with the clearly worse regulations.
