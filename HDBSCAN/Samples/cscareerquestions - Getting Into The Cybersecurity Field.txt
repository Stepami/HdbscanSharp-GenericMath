Getting Into The Cybersecurity Field
I'm currently studying to get my bachelors in computer science, but have really taken an interest in cybersecurity, mainly pen testing as I know cybersecurity is such a wide field. I was wondering if there were certain things I should be doing to get more on track of getting into the cybersecurity field. I'm going to school in NY, and am currently a sophomore with 30 credits. My school also doesn't offer actual cybersecurity bachelors degree, they just have 2 courses that are network security and computer security, aimed toward seniors. Any information would be great! Thank you very much  submitted by /u/Ashrus [link] [comments]
