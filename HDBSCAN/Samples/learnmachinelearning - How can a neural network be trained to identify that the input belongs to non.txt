How can a neural network be trained to identify that the input belongs to none of the trained labels?
Hope I'm right here! I try to learn more about neural networks and while I understand how a network could be used to differentiate between certain labels (always pick the label of the output neuron with the highest output value), I don't really see the concept of how a neural network can differentiate between different labels AND noise. In other words: How can a neuronal network identify different labels, but also identify that there is none of the previously trained labels in the input? How can this behavior be achieved?  submitted by /u/knoedel_muncher [link] [comments]
