/u/nucleosidase on How much ML coursework/experience is needed to actually be able to work in the industry?
By and large, most of the MS candidates I interviewed had done a MS in a different field and were using online courses to transition. So yeah, they did lag behind the PhDs. The PhDs did well regardless of field. One that really knocked my socks off had a background in epidemiology and had really developed an intuitive understanding of data. I don't think you necessarily need to go this route for a job, but two of the candidates we had with just a Bachelor's blurted out that they'd be willing to work for free and we still didn't hire them.
