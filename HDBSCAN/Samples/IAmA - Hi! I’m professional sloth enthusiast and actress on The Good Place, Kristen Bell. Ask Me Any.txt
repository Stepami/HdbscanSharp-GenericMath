Hi! Iâ€™m professional sloth enthusiast and actress on The Good Place, Kristen Bell. Ask Me Anything!
A new episode of my show, The Good Place, airs tonight at 8:30/7:30c on NBC. This season is extra fun, extra bonkers and EXTRA clam chowder. I hope you check it out! You can also catch up on the first season on Netflix. In the meantime, ask me anything!
