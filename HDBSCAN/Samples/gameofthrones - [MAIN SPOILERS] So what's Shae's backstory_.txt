[MAIN SPOILERS] So what's Shae's backstory?
It's something I've noticed during my rewatches in the past and I don't believe it's ever really been addressed, even in the books. Tyrion tries to prod her into revealing a bit about herself during their first "drinking game" in Season 1 and her past becomes a consistent point of curiosity during her interactions with Cersei, Sansa, et al. at King's Landing in Season 2 and beyond, but all of them end up with her either dodging the inquiry or being cut off from answering entirely. Is all this narrative blue-balling D&D's way of giving her an air of Lorathi mystery, or is our foreign beauty just not that interesting?  submitted by /u/Vinophilia [link] [comments]
