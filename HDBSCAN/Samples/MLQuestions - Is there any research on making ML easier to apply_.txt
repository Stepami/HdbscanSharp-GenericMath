Is there any research on making ML easier to apply?
I have an engineering background. A common complain I hear about ML is that it has to be very tuned in order to be effective, otherwise "regular" methods like ARX (regression) or FDA (Classification) are preferable. Is there any work on creating heuristic or guidelines? Most research I find is about achieving better accuracy, AUC or other metric, and it uses highly tuned models. I ask this because most engineers in the industry have deadlines and other responsabilities; tuning a model is very time expensive.  submitted by /u/FellowOfHorses [link] [comments]
