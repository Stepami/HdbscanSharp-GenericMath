/u/SirApatosaurus on New PTR Patch doesn't give Mercy a rez cd reset after ulting anymore
Her hitbox needs to be a little chunkier I feel. Especially when flying it gets extremely wonky and hard to hit. I've seen things literally go right through her. Playing DF in to her is really annoying as well (although that might be because it's him), and I can't count the number of times lately I've gone straight through her.
