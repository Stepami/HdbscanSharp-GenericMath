/u/OfficialDiscoveryAMA on Redditors, how do you absolutely nail a job interview?
Research the company before going to the interview. Shower. Shave. Put on a decent suit. Firm handshake. Eye contact. Smile when first meeting and appropriate. Keep your answers to questions brief and avoid tangents, but if you can throw in a joke or two that will always a plus. You may at one point be asked if you have any questions for them. This is where your research comes into play and you can ask some relevant questions. Keep it short and try to only have one or two. At the end tell them you're interested in the position and ask what the next step will be. The next day send a thank you note. Nothing desperate, just a thank you for meeting with me, I appreciate your time. If you don't get the job at least you made a good impression and that always goes a long way to eventually nailing a job down. Hang in there and good luck, you've got this.
