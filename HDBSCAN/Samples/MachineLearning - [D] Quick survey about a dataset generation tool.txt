[D] Quick survey about a dataset generation tool
Hello. I'm part of a startup that is working on an automated dataset generation tool. For example, if you want a dataset of images of orange kittens, our tool will generate the images and send them to you. We're starting out with image datasets but plan to expand to other types later on. Note: this tool intelligently gathers information from the web, so it'll only work if the item you need a dataset of is something there's publicly-available information on. In other words it won't work for highly domain-specific applications. For example, a dataset of pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S8 will work, but a dataset of screenshots from your app won't. We have a survey to see if there's any interest in this, you can fill it out here. It's just six questions :) Thanks!  submitted by /u/leaf_ai [link] [comments]
