/u/iCoeur285 on Stephen King can get rich and famous by writing horror novels, but when I tried to write horror stories in middle school my mental health was questioned.
I once drew a very... morbid picture for art class on Halloween. We were told to draw a creepy/scary picture. I drew a girl hanging from a tree covered in blood. Some of the other students at my table complained to the teacher that my picture was too scary and they didn't like it. My art teacher shrugged and said "That's art for you" and walked away. I got an A too! Years later, I was in a senior creative writing class. We had to write a short story based on the prompt "It's raining cats and dogs". Everyone wrote stories about people catching and adopting the animals. I wrote a more realistic story that involved the animals dying on impact, destroying houses and vehicles, and hitting and killing people. My teacher wrote "Oh... okay." at the end and gave me an A.
