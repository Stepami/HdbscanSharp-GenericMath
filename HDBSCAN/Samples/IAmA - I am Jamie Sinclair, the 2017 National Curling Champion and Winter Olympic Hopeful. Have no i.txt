I am Jamie Sinclair, the 2017 National Curling Champion and Winter Olympic Hopeful. Have no idea what Curling is? Let me tell you about it. AMA!
I am the 2017 National Curling Champion and I throw rocks at houses! I was born in Anchorage Alaska and figured an ice sport would be perfect for me. If you're not familiar with curling, check out my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/curlupwithjamie) for some fun tidbits and insights into my life on the competitive curling tour.
