/u/a_lumberjack on Usmanov statement. He won't sell any shares in Arsenal to Kroenke
What this means is that neither has any reason to invest a fucking cent into the club. Usmanov won't because he doesn't have control, and because Kroenke will reap twice the benefit. Kroenke won't because he'll only keep 2/3 of the return on investment, and make any future buyout of Usmanov (or more likely, Usmanov's heirs), more expensive. That's fine if you don't want the club to grow inorganically (i.e. through a rich owner injecting a bunch of case), but not great if you want to see greater ambition from ownership.
