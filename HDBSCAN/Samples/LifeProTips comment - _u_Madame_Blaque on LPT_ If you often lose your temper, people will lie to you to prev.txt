/u/Madame_Blaque on LPT: If you often lose your temper, people will lie to you to prevent an outburst. If you want people to trust you, even with "bad news", learn to control your temper and manage your anger.
Its called repressing to make others feel comfortable. Its one thing if you're punching someone out or throwing things, that's immaturity. People are allowed to feel their feelings if something upsets them. No one can tell someone else how they should or shouldn't feel.
