/u/jmmcd on How to do one class classification using neural nets?
Well you didn't say what you were looping over, but I think you were looping over 1000 training points and aggregating their loss. A while ago I wrote some code for education purposes, see GitHub.com/jmmcd/ML-snippets/dbocc (I'm on mobile, please click around if link not quite right). It doesn't do a NN but illustrates the threshold idea for other OCC methods e.g. a simple Gaussian density. It might be easier to discuss the idea of a threshold on individual values in that context. Edit how to compute individual loss -- sorry, I'm not good at Tensorflow.
