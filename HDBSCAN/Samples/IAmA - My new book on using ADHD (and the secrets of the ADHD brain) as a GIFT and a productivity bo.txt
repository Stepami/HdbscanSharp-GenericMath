My new book on using ADHD (and the secrets of the ADHD brain) as a GIFT and a productivity booster just published, and it's #1 on Amazon right now! AMA!
I have ADHD, and realized many years ago that if managed correctly (not with meds, per se,) it could a huge gift, that having a faster brain is actually a huge bonus. I've started and sold three companies, I'm an Ironman Triathlete, a dad, a licensed skydiver, and I'm all over the world giving keynotes on the Customer Experience and ADHD. I run the #1 podcast on ADHD on iTunes, and today, Random House published my book on the same topic, called Faster Than Normal! Let's talk about #ADHD, or anything else - Something shiny! Ooh! A squirrel! Proof: https://i.redd.it/jtmmv6zzrvpz.jpg  submitted by /u/skydivinghuman [link] [comments]
