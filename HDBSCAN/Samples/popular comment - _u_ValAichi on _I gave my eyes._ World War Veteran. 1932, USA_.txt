I disagree. Mao was just incompetent, and Stalin, while he killed millions, did that to hold on to power, a relatively 'normal', abet horrific, motivation. Both of those puts them well above Hitler and the Nazi's, who decided millions had to die not for any physical reason, but because their ideology saw them as inferior.
