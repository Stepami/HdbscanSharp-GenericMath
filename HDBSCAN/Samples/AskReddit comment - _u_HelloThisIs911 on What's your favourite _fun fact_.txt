/u/HelloThisIs911 on What's your favourite "fun fact"?
911 operator here. Here in the US, most states have medical amnesty laws. If you're suffering an overdose, you generally won't be charged as long as you haven't committed any other crimes. If you OD on heroin and call 911, you won't go to jail for possession or use of the drugs. Some college campuses have similar policies as well for underage drinking. Some people think it encourages drug use, but people are going to do drugs either way. It's like in Vancouver how they have vending machines that sell clean crackpipes and needles. Sharing used needles is a huge risk, so if they're going to do it anyway, at least make it safer for them.
