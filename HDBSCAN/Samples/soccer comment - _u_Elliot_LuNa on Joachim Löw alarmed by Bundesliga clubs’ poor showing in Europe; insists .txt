/u/Elliot_LuNa on Joachim Löw alarmed by Bundesliga clubs’ poor showing in Europe; insists it is too early to dismiss German clubs in Europe this season but claimed the quality of the Bundesliga has been exaggerated for too long.
Nothing happened really, apart from them getting old and retiring, or us getting offered 50 million for a 20 year old. We have plenty of exciting players still, but they aren't very known since we have a pretty young team with a lot of talent. Players to look out for in Schalke are Harit, Goretzka, Bentaleb, Embolo, and McKennie. Imo they're our biggest talents right now. Money isn't really an issue, Schalke are huge in Germany and are quite rich. It's just that like most German clubs we dont spend much on transfers. We still(usually at least heh) achieve good results through strong academies and good scouts, so spending 50+million on a great talent from the portuguese league or something isn't really that necessary for us.
