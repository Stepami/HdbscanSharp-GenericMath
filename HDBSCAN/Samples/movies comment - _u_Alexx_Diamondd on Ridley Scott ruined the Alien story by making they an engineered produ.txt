/u/Alexx_Diamondd on Ridley Scott ruined the Alien story by making they an engineered product instead of something shaped and hardened over hundreds of millions of years
Meh, I liked it. I'm all for mystery on a lot of movie creatures and mythos's but the Aliens were always something that I really wanted to know more about. Then again, I also enjoyed Prometheus and Covenant so my opinion on this topic is probably void.
