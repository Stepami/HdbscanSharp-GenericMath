If you want to get into core computer science, I would suggest starting off with Microprocessor Architecture, and then moving on to Operating Systems and Compiler Design. To understand practical implementations of the above, you've got to be familiar with concepts of Data Structures and relevant Algorithms. Another massive field would be Computer Networks, if that interests you. In any case, Data Structures are the bread and butter of computer science, so maybe start with the C programming language, and implement basic structures. To improve on problem solving / programming, I'd suggest competitive coding platforms such as HackerRank and HackerEarth.
