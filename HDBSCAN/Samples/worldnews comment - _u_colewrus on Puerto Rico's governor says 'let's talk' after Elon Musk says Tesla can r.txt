/u/colewrus on Puerto Rico's governor says 'let's talk' after Elon Musk says Tesla can rebuild the island's power grid
Isn't the benefit of tesla style powergrids is that they are largely decentralized?

Serious question though this is all coming from a fairly off hand tweet by musk so maybe we're all reading too much into this
