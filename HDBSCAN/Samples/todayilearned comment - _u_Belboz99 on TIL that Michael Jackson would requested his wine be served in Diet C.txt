/u/Belboz99 on TIL that Michael Jackson would requested his wine be served in Diet Coke cans during flights, because he didn't want his kids to see him drinking alcohol.
One of the best Scout Masters I ever had was a regular smoker, but refused to smoke around the kids. Most kids never even knew he smoked, and if they did, they never saw it. He'd smoke while running errands or driving solo on trips. What I also didn't realize until I was an adult was that he enforced that policy with the other adults. There were plenty of other adults who were smokers that I also never knew, because they weren't allowed to smoke in front of the boys. Sitting around a campfire after lights out, a dad who came along as more of a chaperone than a leader, was quickly informed of this policy years after the Scout Leader's passing... even though all the boys were asleep.
