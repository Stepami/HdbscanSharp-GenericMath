Learn VueJS by working on an open source project!
Hello everyone, I've been building a cryptocurrency / bitcoin education website for a few months now using NodeJS and VueJS. I noticed Vue is pretty well liked around here and many are looking to learn it. I've worked with it for 2 years now and would love to teach and learn from others that would like to work on the project. If you're interested, send me a message and I'll invite you to the project slack channel.
