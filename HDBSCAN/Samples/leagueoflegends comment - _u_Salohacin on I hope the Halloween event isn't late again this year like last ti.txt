/u/Salohacin on I hope the Halloween event isn't late again this year like last time.
Just a random question: How many people purchase skins because of things like holidays going on? Personally I've never thought: Oh it's Halloween, I'll buy a Halloween skin, although I do have some of the harrowing skins simply because I liked them irrespective of whether or not it was Halloween. Similarly I've never bought winter themed skins because it was near Christmas but because I liked the skins (I love Santa Braum, Poro Sledging out of the base is amazing).
