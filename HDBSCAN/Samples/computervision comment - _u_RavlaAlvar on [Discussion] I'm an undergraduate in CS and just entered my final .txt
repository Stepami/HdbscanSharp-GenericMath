/u/RavlaAlvar on [Discussion] I'm an undergraduate in CS and just entered my final year. I have an idea for a final year project in computer vision. I want to achieve a top grade in this but I'm afraid I don't have enough knowledge to do so. What do you recommend?
I dont think you should replicate sota in undergrad level. Moreover, it is deep learning, you learn nothing about the underlying geometrical problem that the ML model tried to solve instead you just learn how to use DL framework. If you wanted to do pose estimation, I would suggest starting from small problem (like hand gesture) and try to solve it with geometry based (might be with some classical ML element) algorithm .
