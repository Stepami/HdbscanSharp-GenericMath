How do I find the vanishing point position in an image, knowing the rotation of the camera?
I have an image of a calibration pattern, which I know is perpendicular to the ground. From that image I can get the rototranslation of the camera wrt the pattern, which means I can get the angle between the camera and the ground. How do I get the position of the vanishing point in the image (in pixels) from this information? For now I can consider only the vertical position, I expect that the horizontal position can be computed using a similar process. My reasoning is that if the camera is perfectly aligned with the ground (angle between camera and ground is zero) then the vertical coordinate of the vanishing point is ImageVerticalSize/2. If there is an angle, then the vertical coordinate should be ImageVerticalSize/2 - focal_length * tan(angle). However, the result I get is not correct, even with a small angle I get a position that is several pixels off. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!  submitted by /u/zuzzurezzu [link] [comments]
