AMA Request: Monopoly Man at Equifax Hearing
I have far too many questions about how this person did this, and what it took to get all of those things together for that moment. How did he acquire those items? What pushed them to actually do this? How much did it cost to look like Monopoly Man AND get into the Senate Hearing? Does he have any other costumes? Is he going to continue? It's absolutely ingenious, and Is deserving of some recognition. They may also have quite a bit of good info on how to be a politically active caricature too.  submitted by /u/ThaddeusWhelan [link] [comments]
