Need Advice for Development...
I'm trying to create a checklist that can be accessed via mobile device where users are presented a list of inventory items to confirm they are working properly. The users should be able to see all of the items in real-time and if one user checks the item off(and can un-check it if it was checked inadvertently) then it disappears from another users list. The checklist should also track the user who is checking off each item and document who has checked what. Additionally, it should save the final checklist with who has checked what to a storage device of some sort. Can someone identify any sort of platform or structure that I could start with this? Ideally, I'd like some sort of web platform such as a surveymonkey(just as an example).. or something that is already created and I can just modify/customize it to my needs. Any suggestions?  submitted by /u/jgruberman [link] [comments]
