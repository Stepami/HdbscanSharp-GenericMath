For some reason the metrics of precision and recall never really stuck with me. I know what FPs, TPs, FNs, and TNs are, but for whatever reason looking at the metrics never really clicked with me on an intuitive level. Then I thought about it in terms of probability and it started to make sense, so hopefully this explanation will help other people too. Recall can be thought of as "Given that something is positive, what is the probability that I will actually classify it as positive?" And Precision can be thought of as "Given that I did classify something as positive, what's the probability that it is actually positive?"
