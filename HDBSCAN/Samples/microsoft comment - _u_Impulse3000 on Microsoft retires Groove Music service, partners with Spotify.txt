/u/Impulse3000 on Microsoft retires Groove Music service, partners with Spotify
Our library is being switched to Spotify, if you have an account, and if you don't, maybe if you set one up, you should get access, plus you get a refund for your current subscription. Bear in mind, I'm not entirely sure, so you should contact Microsoft support for the full info, and help with this.
