/u/IglooDweller on How can I decompress MS SQL backup without SQL Server...?
I fully understand your points, I'm is simply pointing out that deduping+SQL compression will usually give better physical footprint than simple deduping. While the deduping ratio will usually be lower at about 2:1 instead of 10:1, it's because it doesn't take into account the fact that SQL Server already pre-compressed the data. As shown in the first link on page 13, you can see that 14 daily backups of a 125GB DB resulted in 188GB in storage footprint for only depup (with a depup ratio of 9.26), while dedup+SQL Compression ended up with slightly below 140GB (but with only a 1.87 dedup ratio). Otherwise, if you absolutely want to remove SQL compression to only perform deduping instead of mixing both space saving techniques, I'm afraid the only solution is to restore/recreate the backup.
