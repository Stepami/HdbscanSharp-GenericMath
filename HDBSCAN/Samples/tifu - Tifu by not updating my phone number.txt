Tifu by not updating my phone number
Hello redditors, So this all happened to me recently but mainly all within the last week. So I had to move out of my place because the lease was up on it. Being as the landlord didnt mention it til the week before i had to leave. I should have had a better idea of when the lease was up but we kept extending it and not really keeping track. Which is not a big deal just not much time to find a place. So as i stay at this motel 6 I wake up the 2 mornings after moving out and my car is gone. I call the non emergency police number to report it stolen. Well they let me know the title loan company i had used took the car. So i call the title loan company and they say i need to pay the month we are currently in, the next month and the month after that. The reason they took the car is they were unable to reach me. Well i pay the 600ish to get the car out. The next day i realized the car insurance wasn't coming out each month so i call them and they say it expired in February. So ive been driving 8 months with no insurance. Well along with trying to just survive financially it just seems to keep getting random stuff. The car is a 2000 dodge neon that i had purchased not even 2 years ago that is going out on my electronically some how. Long story short with the car is it is a piece of junk. TL;DR had to pay around $700 because i cant update my information at a timely manner and my car is a piece of junk. Edit: Sorry this was my first post and had a few errors. I also did this on a mobile.  submitted by /u/Grjbeen [link] [comments]
