React + redux + immutable describes my go to web stack, glad to hear someone senior to me finding it outstanding as well. Re: JavaScript crappiness, for typing, have you tried flow? There are a handful of js libs out there that really come in handy, moment comes to mind, of course the stdlib could be improved and something like moment would become irrelevant... I donâ€™t like to even mention react on programming discussion boards tho because I feel like I have to justify myself by pointing out that I write on a bunch of other platforms and languages as well, it gets a lot of shit.
