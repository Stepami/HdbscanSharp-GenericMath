Don't drink too much liquor. You will go to Hell.
Priest - Don't drink too much liquor. You will go to Hell. Alcoholic - Is it? What about the guy who sells the liquor? Priest - He will also go to Hell. Alcoholic - Ok, what about the guy who sells pork tacos in the food truck outside the Liquor Store? Priest - He too will go to Hell. Alcoholic - In that case, I have no problem going to Hell.  submitted by /u/boob_me_y0ur_PM [link] [comments]
