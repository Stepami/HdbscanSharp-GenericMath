LPT: Addicted to a game on your phone but sick of getting ads every time you 'die'? Turn on airplane mode then play without ads until you get your fill.
It won't work with every game, but a lot of them will simply skip the ads and let you play til your dicks content.  submitted by /u/MrBulldops1738 [link] [comments]
