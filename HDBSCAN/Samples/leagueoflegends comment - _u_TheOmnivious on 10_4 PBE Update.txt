/u/TheOmnivious on 10/4 PBE Update
AP Champs still get their +15 or +22AP to start with anyway, that's about what you would start with if you were using a "reasonable" rune page. I've had Lulus cheese me botlane with 26AP level 1, with the new runes that's still possible, except this time I'll have 12 less MR to deal with it. They might add the +12MR to champs in next PBE patch, but the PBE balance will be beyond fucked up in botlane until then.
