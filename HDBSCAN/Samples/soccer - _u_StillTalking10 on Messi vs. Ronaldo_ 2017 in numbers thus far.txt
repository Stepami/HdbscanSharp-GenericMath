/u/StillTalking10 on Messi vs. Ronaldo: 2017 in numbers thus far
Right that automatically makes everything I said wrong. An average ball is in play between 60-65 minutes and that over 20 outfield players is around ~3 players. Sure the better players are on ball for 4-5 minutes but what they do in the other 55 minutes means way more. Watch the games, dont look at stats.
