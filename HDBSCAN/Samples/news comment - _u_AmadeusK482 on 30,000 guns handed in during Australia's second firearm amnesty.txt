/u/AmadeusK482 on 30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty
So I think your primary concern is this: So what if my dad only paid a few hundred for a gun he bought me years ago, it’s worth a lot more to me than a few hundred to me Even if I had no ammo for it lol  What if part of turning the gun in also extended the life of your license for which you're allowed to buy certain types of ammo or certain firearms? That would be equitable. We already have an extensive list of guns not allowed to be owned and a massive government agency to make sure those weapons aren’t just out there floating around, obviously they can’t get everyone of those weapons but I’d say it’s most of them.  Thats precisely my point, we already have restrictions, we need to enhance them in order to curb the proliferation of guns. We don't need Colt, Smith and Wesson, Springfield Armory, Winchester, Remington, Yadda yadda etc etc ... making millions of guns per year.
