Take a break, friend. If you ever lose two matches then stop and be done. I rode a 14 game losing streak out of top-500 because I refused to stop playing. You are likely fatiguing yourself and not playing at the best you can be. Relax, friend, losing streaks happen. For all I know, you are a Master level player; if you take a break and rest you can come back to the game tomorrow or in two days and be ready to roll (after warming up) back into Master.
