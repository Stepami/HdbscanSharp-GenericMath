TIFU punched a kid at homecoming
Today I screwed up homecoming for me and my girlfriend. Imagine having a bunch of popular kids, (spoiled, self centered, assholes), following you and your girlfriend around. When you ask these type.s of kids to stop, they will give you an excuse that will make you cringe. As in me: Why are you following us? Them: To hang out with the chicks! True statement This was a lie because we were all taken and I just can tell when people lie. Then my girlfriend and I went outside to sit down because of a strobe light making us dizzy. The populars had the balls to follow us and make a move on my girlfriend. It pissed me off to the point where I punched the kid right then and there. I got him in the temple and wished I would have broken his nose. The saying DONT TREAD ON ME is accurate to me. I asked them plenty of times to stop but stupidity will get them hurt. I may be young as is 14 but I have a lesson to the kids who like to ruin other people's fun, There will be a time where someone does the right thing and smacks you up the side of the head and says, This is the real world. If you can't keep yourself straight, someone else will. I ended up getting a detention and not being able to join in my trap team. TL;DR I punched a kid at my homecoming dance because he made a move on my girlfriend and I got a detention and am now not eligible for my trap team.  submitted by /u/bennycow1717 [link] [comments]
