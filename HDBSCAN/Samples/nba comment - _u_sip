/u/sip-em_bears on What are some of the greatest games in NBA history?
IDK about great, but one of the most entertaining games is Pistons-Nuggets in '83. Zeke lead the Pistons to a 186-184 3OT win in Denver. Kiki VanDeWeghe dropped 51 and Thomas, John Long, and Alex English all scored at least 40. It's still the highest scoring game in NBA history by 33 points.
