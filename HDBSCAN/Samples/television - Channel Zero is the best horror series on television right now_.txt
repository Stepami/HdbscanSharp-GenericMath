Channel Zero is the best horror series on television right now.
If you're looking for a horror TV series to watch, especially this month, do yourself a favour and check out Channel Zero. Especially the current season (2). It's an anthology so don't worry about watching this season before 1. As a big horror fan, I've found it very hard to get into many television series in the genre for the last few years. There was American Horror Story, that I enjoyed for 2 seasons, then it became bland and tried to go for bizarre over scariness. This series hits the nail on the head and scratches that itch I've been looking for in a show for a long time. It airs on ScyFy in the U.S., but I'm sure it's available elsewhere for people outside of there. If you're like me and have been craving good horror on TV, this one is for you. EDIT: Did some research and found out the show will be airing on Showcase in Canada starting October 26th.  submitted by /u/iacs12 [link] [comments]
