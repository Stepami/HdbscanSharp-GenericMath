/u/Mathilliterate_asian on TIL a week after Hurricane Katrina, after receiving little to no federal supplies, Sheriff Billy McGee stole 2 FEMA trucks full of ice from a U.S. military base to give to the citizens of Forrest County, MS.
I feel like wouldn't that kind of be an excuse for NOT carrying out your duties. Like if Bryant really wanted to help he couldn't just go "take the trucks. I'll pretend I saw nothing." That would have been negligence on his part right? On the other hand if he was actually obstructed then the blame would lie entirely on the sheriff and his accomplices. ... I guess I watch too many movies.
