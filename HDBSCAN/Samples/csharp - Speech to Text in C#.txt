Speech to Text in C#
Hi! I'm working on a project that uses speech recognition, and I am doing it in C#. So, I know about C# built - in System.Speech library, but there's a few problems: I need the recognize function to ouput a string that is a full sentence, not just words specified within the Grammar object. Ex: SpeechRecognitionEngine engine = new SpeechRecognitionEngine(SpeechRecognitionEngine.InstalledRecognizers()[0]);   Choices test = new Choices("Test"); GrammarBuilder gb = new GrammarBuilder(); gb.Append(test); engine.LoadGrammar(new Grammar(gb)); engine.SetInputToDefaultAudioDevice(); engine.RecognizeCompleted += Engine_RecognizeCompleted; engine.Recognize();  Now, Engine_RecognizeCompleted() is called when I say "this is a test," but the output text of the RecognizeCompletedEventArgs is only "test." I need the function to pickup the other words as well. How could I go about doing this?  submitted by /u/theKurdledNoodle [link] [comments]
