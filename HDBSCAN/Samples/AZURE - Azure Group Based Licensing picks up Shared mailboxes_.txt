Azure Group Based Licensing picks up Shared mailboxes?
Hi, I'm just curious if someone else has this issue. Since we're using group based licensing in Azure AD it will pick up a few shared mailboxes and add a license to them. Problem is, it's a F1 license so the shared mailbox becomes a 2gb box only. Has anyone else had this issue, and how did you resolve it?  submitted by /u/baswijdenesdotcom [link] [comments]
