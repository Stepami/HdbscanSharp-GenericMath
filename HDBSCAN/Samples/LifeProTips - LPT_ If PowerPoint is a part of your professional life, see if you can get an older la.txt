LPT: If PowerPoint is a part of your professional life, see if you can get an older laptop from IT to use as a "Presentation Laptop" for you or your team, to avoid embarrassing accidents.
Things like E-Mail alerts can really detract from a presentation. By using a separate laptop that doesn't have your daily work software installed, you can set things up exactly the way you need for each presentation.  submitted by /u/h_erbivore [link] [comments]
