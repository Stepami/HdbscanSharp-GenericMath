/u/Strictlystyles on I really hope there is a special place in hell for these people..
Your right and wrong, just because it’s a widespread practice doesn’t make it any much right and by no means supports any type of theory hat the public at largest likes the practice, they just can’t do anything about it. Even if the majority of consumers don’t solicit the scalpers the small percentage of people with deep pockets will and continues the cycle so again I don’t agree with that. Also it’s common sense because it’s common sense, it’s like asking a consumer do you like getting ripped off and see it as bad practice.... I mean sure you can’t be certain how many ppl will say no, but it’s probably gonna be the majority.
