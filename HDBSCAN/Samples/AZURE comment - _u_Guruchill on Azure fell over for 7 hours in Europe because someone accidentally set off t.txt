/u/Guruchill on Azure fell over for 7 hours in Europe because someone accidentally set off the fire extinguishers • The Register
The Register’s title and article is typically exaggerated and misleading. Only one storage stamp was affected in one facility of many in Dublin. There are many stamps per facility, and many facilities in a region. A tiny portion of Azure storage was unavailable - if a solution had been architected correctly then it would have remained available throughout this incident. It’s a timely reminder that you need to architect for the cloud; not throw a solution there and let the magic cloud pixies make it work. My own opinions not those of my employer.
