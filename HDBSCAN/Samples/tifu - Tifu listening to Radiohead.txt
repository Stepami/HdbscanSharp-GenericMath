Tifu listening to Radiohead
So I am a big Radiohead fan living in a tropical state. It was a very gloomy day with heavy rain ,college had just ended and I was on my way home . Suddenly I had this strong urge to listen to OK Computer so I put the album on shuffle, wore my earphones , then my helmet and was on my way home,I also increased the volume to 88 at paranoid android,I must say it was a beautiful experience, Radiohead in the rain is just😍😍,then came let down , and if you haven't heard this song I strongly recommend you listen to it right now ,2min into the song and I'm completely zoned out,at 3:40 when the bridge starts,unknowingly I end up traveling at 90km per hour . The bike slips goes on the wrong lane I hit a oncoming truck ,break a few bones and bruised knees and palms . Now I'm on the hospital ,waiting for my parents,listening to exit music. TL;DR: Was listening to Radiohead on full volume while on bike,exceeded the speed limit ,slipped ,hit a truck ,almost died.  submitted by /u/isaywaar [link] [comments]
