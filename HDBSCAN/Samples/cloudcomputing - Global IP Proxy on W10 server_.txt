Global IP Proxy on W10 server?
This is sort of a strange request...I'm attempting to route ALL of my server traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy. Trying to use my personal SOCKS5 proxy in addition to cloud computing from Google. Long story short, I'm attempting to visit sites that have banned Google Cloud's IP subnets. I have clean IPs via Squid on my home network, but I prefer to use Google for the VM. Of course I tried the normal method of adding a proxy to W10 with internet options > LAN and the "newer" option of settings>Network & Internet > proxy but these settings don't apply to the likes of Chrome or CMD prompt. I'm using nodejs and other platforms to open multiple headless browsers on a website, but it would seem simpler if there were a method to put allow my proxy over the entire VM opposed to each individual script. Thank you in advance.  submitted by /u/jshah1018 [link] [comments]
