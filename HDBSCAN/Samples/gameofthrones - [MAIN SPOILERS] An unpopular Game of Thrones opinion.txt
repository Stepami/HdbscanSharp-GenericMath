[MAIN SPOILERS] An unpopular Game of Thrones opinion
I like the white walkers and the army of the dead, but am I the only one who found the political battle between the houses of Westeros in the earlier seasons to be far more interesting? Starks vs. Lannisters, The War of Five Kings, Tyrion's trial and even the The High Sparrow sparked my interest more than the white walkers who just seem like a generic fantasy trope.  submitted by /u/lileastjaystreet [link] [comments]
