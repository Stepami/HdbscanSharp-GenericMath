/u/OleoleCholoSimeone on Matteo Darmian on Premier League - "There are some differences with respect to Italian football. It’s more physical, a little less tactical. This ‘lack’ of tactics can lead to a different game, faster and maybe more dynamic. It’s just two different styles."
I don't think it's meant as an insult. He is talking about the mentality and identity of English football. Every league is unique, every country has a certain mentality and view of how the game should be played, it doesn't have to be bad thing. Individual coaches aren't gonna affect the way other teams play and how football is viewed instantly. It will likely be in 10-15 years time when coaches inspired by the likes of Pochettino, Conte, Pep, Mourinho etc will appear that we will see a more continental style in the PL. The biggest difference isn't the quality of top flight managers, but the quality of youth coaching and especially the fact that players don't have anywhere near the awareness and understanding of tactics that their german, italian or spanish counterparts have. Even Pep has had to change his approach because of the sheer number of long balls. Just compare the Championship to Segunda or Bundesliga 2, the difference in technical ability and ability to keep possession of the ball is pretty big.
