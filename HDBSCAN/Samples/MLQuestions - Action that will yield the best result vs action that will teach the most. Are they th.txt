Action that will yield the best result vs action that will teach the most. Are they the same action?
For example, if you have 5 buttons(A,B,C,D,E), pressing a button will give you a score from 1 to 10. Imagine you have gotten the following scores after pressing certain buttons: A => 6, 6, 7 B => 5 C => 6 D => 9 E => not pressed Now, if you wanted to get the highest score you can on the next button press, you would press D, because it has the highest average score(or A? because it has a bigger sample?). But imagine that you don't care about the score on the next button press, but you want the highest possible score on the press after that one. What button should you press to learn the most? Is that D too, because it has the highest score? Or maybe E, because you haven't tried that one out yet?  submitted by /u/Alvittawa [link] [comments]
