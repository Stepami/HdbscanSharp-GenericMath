Company wants interview about 150 miles away, do I ask for the bus/train faire?
A large company asked me for an interview, I haven't responded yet. It'll cost me some $60 or so to get there in person, if they don't offer, should I ask? I've never interviewed in person this far away, but when I drove a friend, they offered compensation, I don't know if he asked or not. In town, no problem, but I can't afford to do many of these in person interviews. Just 10 of them would be some $600+. I know someone else that just got a plane ticket but he was some 300 miles out, I'm about 150. Is it automatic at some point? How do I ask? Note: the timing of this is not that great as I'm just now starting to rework all my stuff, so I don't want to blow this shot by asking for travel fees, but I can't afford a 300mile round trip for every interview.  submitted by /u/_tempAccount_ [link] [comments]
