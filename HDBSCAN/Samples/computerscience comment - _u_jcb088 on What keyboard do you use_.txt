/u/jcb088 on What keyboard do you use?
At home I use this: https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Ivory-920-003365/dp/B004ZKXXAK/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1507315865&sr=8-9&keywords=logitech+white+keyboard It was 30$ at staples when I bought it so ignore the price. Its small and great for moving around if you have to have a book or notepad or whatever on your desk. I use it a lot in college and i've noticed that is more important than most other keyboard things as far as quality of life. Its quiet, has more of a thmp than a click and it still has a number pad without being too wide. I've owned it for.... idunno 6 or 7 years (maybe longer?) and i've used it to write code, play World of Warcraft, other videogames, etc. It's taken suuuch a beating over the years and holds up well. Its wireless and I use rechargeable batteries on it, they last 4 to 6 months per charge. Me gusta.
