/u/dangerouslyloose on TIFU by putting on my dog's anti-bark collar
My cousins (2 boys with a long-suffering little sis) had one of those invisible fence collars for their dog. Being the terrible, terrible children we were (ages 7-11 or so), we pooled like $1 in change to get her to run through the fence holding the collar. That was a dollar well spent- she earned every bit of it.
