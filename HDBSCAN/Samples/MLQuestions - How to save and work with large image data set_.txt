How to save and work with large image data set?
But not very large. I have 40000 images of 50000 pixels each. As I am used to, right now I am transferring them to csv file. Each row is just pixels. But I think there are better ways. What are the best practices to work with them? My other ideas: ---save pixels in database ---do not translate to pixels now. when model trains, just load a batch of pictures, get their pixels and train there I am not sure which one is best and fastest or there are other methods. My thoughts: ---It's better to get pixels, because if not, on each epoch much time will go to transferring. ---csv file will be around 30 gigs. is it ok? is it possible to read it partly somehow? What do you think?  submitted by /u/valerka1010 [link] [comments]
