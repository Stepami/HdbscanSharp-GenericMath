computer science vs information systems
listening to my professors talk about the math and logic that computer science majors go through, I am beginning to feel my information systems degree puts me at a major disadvantage when competing for the same jobs that CS majors are going for. Does anyone know what I should learn to better market myself than the typical CS majors?  submitted by /u/Duydoraemon [link] [comments]
