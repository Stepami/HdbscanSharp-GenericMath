/u/Maelstrom52 on 'I loathe these people': Rick and Morty and the brilliant backlash against TV's bad fans
Gotcha. So, my response would be there is a difference between "quantitative" vs "qualitative" statements. Crime rates, murder rates, etc. generally tend to be addressed in a quantitative way. If they're being used as a way to demean an individual of a particular racial group, then it should absolutely be called out as racism. Usually, when people make racist statements about minorities they are called out. The problem that I see is this trend of calling out "whiteness" for being a toxic influence in society, and that is absolutely a racist statement. To the effect that someone is simply making a quantitative statement about white people, no, that is not racist, and actually is a necessary piece of the puzzle for creating public policy. I would argue that I have not seen many racist statement s for minorities go unchallenged, but there seems to be A LOT of racist statements made about white people that are socially acceptable now.
