Clustering categorical events in time series
As title. I have a long time series with a large, sparse number of events. Each event has multiple attributes on top of the top it occurred. Summary Some of these events are independent, some are not. Usually the dependent events will depend on the combination of attributes they have (e.g. a Type A event generates a Type B event 15 minutes later with both having the same X attribute). Some combinations of events produce other events (e.g. a Type A12 on its own does nothing, but a Type A12 and B13 together produce E33, F44 and G51 events). Events might also trigger other events at a later point in time, but I think it's easier to just look at events occurring within a short window for the moment. Objective I want to identify from my data set which events are likely related to each other. I have looked at a few options but gotten nowhere. Any suggestions?  submitted by /u/dk12340568565 [link] [comments]
