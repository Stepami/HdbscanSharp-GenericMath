Mac Specs for CS Program
I am about to head to school for Computer Science and I'm trying to figure out the best computer to do so. I am leaning more towards a MacBook Pro. Would 16GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage and an i5 processor be okay? Or should I upgrade any of them...I'm looking at the i7.  submitted by /u/ericalyn9 [link] [comments]
