Anyone here attending ICIP2017?
If so, would anyone have interest in doing a private, strenuous hike in on the great wall, the 'Greatwall Challenge At Jiankou'? If we get enough people, the price drops per person significantly... Even if you aren't into that, we could get a community going of people who might want to do some tourism together in the Beijing area.
