/u/POWBOOMBANG on Making A Murderer's Steven Avery denied new trial
The finding of the keys is actually worse. If I recall, his entire house was searched for a few hours by a third party county because of his relationship with Manitowoc County. No keys were found.

This whole process screams they they thought he was guilty and tried to grease the wheels.
