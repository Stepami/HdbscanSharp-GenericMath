/u/abrokensheep on What basic life skill were you surprised to find your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse didn't have when you first started dating?
How to make tea. Here's the conversation: Her: "This tea tastes pretty bland" Me: "How long did you steep it for?" Her: "Steep?" Me: "Yeah..." Her: "What's that mean?" Me: "Like when you leave the teabag in the water for a few minutes so the flavor can come out." Her: "Oh, I didn't know you had to do that. I've only ever made sweet tea, from a powder"
