/u/Tastyleg on Different Ways To Heal, If Blizzard Needs Ideas.
Vadasi from Gigantic is a good example of a sacrificial healer, it'd be awesome to see a more strategic healer like her in OW. Paladins also has interesting healers like Ying who's kinda a builder/healer hybrid. I'd also like to see more supports who aren't even healers. Lucio's prevalence in every meta shows just how important other forms of buffs like speed can be. The only other heroes with influence over speed are Mei and Sym and they're hella inconsistent and map-specific. Overall there seems to be a lot of untapped potential in OW for supports. I can understand that they're pretty hard to design given their propensity to break the meta (AHEM, Ana...) but us healsluts are dying out here, dangit.
