TIFU by trimming my beard for the first time in months.
Literally happened in the last hour, I'm so annoyed with myself. I've been growing my beard out since June, and had a good 2-3 inches all over, but I decided to tidy the edges up a little before our niece's birthday party. Of course that's not an issue, so I planned on doing it this morning. In the last few weeks I've also been working out to try and keep healthy and lose the tire around my waist. So, this morning I decided that I would work out, trim my beard a little bit and then have a shower. But I should have trimmed before working out, because my arms were shaky after lifting some weights. Shaky right hand meant I took a massive chunk off my jaw line, and I couldn't possibly even it out without trimming the whole thing down to about 5mm in length and fully shaved beneath my chin. My wife loved my long beard, she's going to be as devastated as I am. TLDR; hands were shaky after lifting weights, which meant that my efforts to tidy the edges of my beard were disastrous.  submitted by /u/TinyDonkey4 [link] [comments]
