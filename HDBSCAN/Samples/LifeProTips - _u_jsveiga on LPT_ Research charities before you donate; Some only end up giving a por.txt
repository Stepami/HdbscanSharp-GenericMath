/u/jsveiga on LPT: Research charities before you donate; Some only end up giving a portion of your donation, and some people will just try to scam you.
So true... I had been regularly donating to a child cancer charity for years, and when I mentioned it to my sister (a journalist, better informed than dumb engineer me), she pointed out the founder of that organization got rich very quick, drove around town in luxury cars, and that the organization had officially lost charity tax incentives years before due to shady usage of the funds :-/
