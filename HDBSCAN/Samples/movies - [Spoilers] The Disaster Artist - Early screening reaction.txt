[Spoilers] The Disaster Artist - Early screening reaction
Preface: Putting spoiler tags because other times I've done this, even when I don't think I spoiled anything, people are upset and say I did. I was lucky enough to view The Disaster Artist this morning. I'm baffled by how much I loved this movie. Up until a year ago I knew next to nothing of The Room, but a group of us watched it yesterday in preparation for today...and SO glad I did. It makes me appreciate it that much more. I listened to the podcast episode of "How Did This Get Made?" this morning about The Room. They talked with Greg Sistero on it since I'm now fascinated with the whole thing. But this movie, they really knocked it out of the park. Everyone involved. It was heartfelt and hilarious. At the very least, watch The Room at least once before you see The Disaster Artist. But this is now one of my favorite movies of the year and no way it won't be an Oscar contender. I'll do my best to answer any questions since we didn't sign an NDA.  submitted by /u/Intense_tents [link] [comments]
