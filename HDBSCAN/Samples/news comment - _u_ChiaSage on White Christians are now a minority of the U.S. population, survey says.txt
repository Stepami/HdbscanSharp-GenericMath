/u/ChiaSage on White Christians are now a minority of the U.S. population, survey says
I don't think you're describing that General Assembly accurately, either. Yes, the idea that there are non-Jesus paths to salvation is not a majority belief in Christianity. But as I recall, the PCUSA didn't have a majority of people championing that belief at the 2001 General Assembly, either. Instead, it had a minority in favor of that belief but not pushing a resolution, and a minority strongly opposed to that belief and wanting to exclude that other minority from Church life, pushing a resolution. That's not a Christian way to behave, and the resolution of the excluders was defeated, in favor of language that allowed the targeted minority to stay and be accepted. That's not at all the same thing as the Church rejecting Jesus.
