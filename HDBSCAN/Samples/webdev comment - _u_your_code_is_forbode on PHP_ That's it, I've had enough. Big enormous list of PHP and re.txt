/u/your_code_is_forbode on PHP: That's it, I've had enough. Big enormous list of PHP and related anti patterns...
I don't until it screws up the code which is what I'm explaining here. These tools can be pretty dangerous in the wrong hands. They allow productivity in the form of producing more lines of code but not necessarily working code. You can also make code that's terribly structured but up to an extent the IDE compensated. That code then becomes difficult to manage with anything other than that IDE. If people are unrolling variables and being hyper explicit creating reams of code that really had no other purpose than to help the IDE do static analysis, to the extend of having 10000 lines of code instead of 2000 lines of code then something went wrong. The approach to take with these IDEs is when it works great, otherwise ignore it. The alternative is that you might as well be programming in another language that better supports static analysis.
