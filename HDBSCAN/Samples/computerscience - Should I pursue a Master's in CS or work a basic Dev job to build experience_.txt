Should I pursue a Master's in CS or work a basic Dev job to build experience?
My endgame is to work for Google or have a high salary with another big company. Current job CAN pay well, but the management gets in the way and often times I cannot do any work at all. Paid for production, not hourly. Also it's manual labor so I end up being drained and tired after work. I'll have my B.A. in Foreign Language this December as well as a Harvard Certification for some coding ability via Edx's CS50. A nonprofit in my area is facilitating this alongside companies in my area looking to hire new trained workers. One such company is FedEx. So long as I complete this class, I'm pretty much guaranteed an offer as a junior developer. I want to get a Master's in CS because companies like Google look for minimum of B.S. in CS or equivalent while they prefer someone with a Master's. I would pursue this course either full-time or part-time, depending on what job I have, beginning Fall 2018 at the earliest. I need to fulfill some math requirements before then (specifically Calc I&II and Linear Algebra). I'm allowed to take those within the first year of the Master's program. What do you guys think? Pursue my Master's? Just work for FedEx as long as I can and learn as many coding languages as possible while trying to get in with Google without grad school? tl;dr... Master's in CS for Google or try to up my game while working for FedEx as a developer? Any and all book/site recommendations for math or coding is much appreciated.  submitted by /u/Loverofgaming [link] [comments]
