/u/unleashcloud on Pink slips for on-prem datacenter staff in next 2 years? Or, will they find ways to adapt?
It could be that larger enterprises have more people, process, tech and organisational change to work through. A size of business where a hybrid model is explored over a cloud first strategy. Or is the strategy. Mileage may vary. I have helped organisations with headcount in 3, 4 and 5 figures move to the cloud. The trend is the same, the speed varies. The pace of change is inversely proportional to the size of the organisation, influenced further by regulation, risk tolerance and other factors.
