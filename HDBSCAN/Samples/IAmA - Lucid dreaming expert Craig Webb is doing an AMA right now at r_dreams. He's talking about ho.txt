Lucid dreaming expert Craig Webb is doing an AMA right now at r/dreams. He's talking about how to use dreams for more self-awareness and life fulfillment. Plus, hey, ask anything about lucid dreaming. Link inside.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/6yhdig/ama_ask_me_anything_forum_with_craig_sim_webb/ BIO: I have been exploring, researching, writing about, and interpreting dreams for 3 decades, with well over 10k recorded dreams and 1k lucid dreams. It has been such an amazing journey, though not without plenty of challenges and life lessons. Although I am not always the quickest learner, dreams have helped immeasurably in so many ways to help me along and offer insights that seem to be valuable for others too.
