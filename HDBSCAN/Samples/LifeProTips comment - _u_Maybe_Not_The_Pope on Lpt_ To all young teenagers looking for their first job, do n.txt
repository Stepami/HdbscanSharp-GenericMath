/u/Maybe_Not_The_Pope on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
I got my first job when my mom talked to someone she knew that ran a restaurant that was hiring. She came home and told me that we were going to this place to eat. When we got there, we ate and then she told me that I had to go talk to the manager in the back so I could get a job. I got hired on the spot and worked there for like 4 years.
