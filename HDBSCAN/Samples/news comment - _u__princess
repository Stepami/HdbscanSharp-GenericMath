/u/_princess- on Columbus Day designated as Indigenous Peoples Day in Salt Lake City
There is already a yearly gathering called Gathering of Natives. In Alaska we have a yearly convention called Alaska Federation of Natives where we get together and discuss issues (subsistence laws, suicide, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if its the same in other states. Honestly it's enough to just be aware of the local tribes/nations. For so long it seemed like America was ignoring the existence of Native Americans. The renaming to Indigenous day is actually kinda rad. Alaska did it back in 2015 and nothing really changed but it's a nice touch.
