/u/WeGonnaBChampionship on My issue with Bill Simmons is he may have rewritten basketball history by changing facts in his "Book of Basketball" (x-post r/sixers)
Just want to chime in and say my copy cites Giant Steps as well, not Loose Balls. OP would you mind putting this whole thing to rest by taking a picture and posting the page where it cites Loose Balls?
