Well you have things like wordpress that do 95% of the work for you already. That has not impacted webdev jobs as far as I can see... If anything it created a lot of junior/freelance jobs around the platform. People will always want custom things you can't find in templates. Bigger companies that process enough data to care about optimization will always need dedicated developers. Someone has to write and maintain the template sites or code-writing AI in the future. People will always want more features added. Search Engine Optimization (getting your website to show up as the first result on google) is a thing and is not really automatable.
