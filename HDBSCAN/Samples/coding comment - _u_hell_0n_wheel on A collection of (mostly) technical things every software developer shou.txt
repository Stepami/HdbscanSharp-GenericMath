/u/hell_0n_wheel on A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.
A problem with a collection like this is that there's no organization that helps a developer focus her efforts. If you just splat a list like this on someone's head, where are they to start? What would be most apropos for their current work? What order would be most helpful if one wanted to read through it in chunks? This could well be a giant time suck...
