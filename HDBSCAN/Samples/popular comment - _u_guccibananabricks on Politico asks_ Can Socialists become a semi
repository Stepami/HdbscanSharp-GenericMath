/u/guccibananabricks on Politico asks: Can Socialists become a semi-deranged Democratic Party pressure group/astroturf, just like the Teabaggers?
Does the author even understand that "power" is not necessarily the same as winning popular support and elections? The two parties are empowered by the donors, institutions and the duopoly -- not by popular support for their policies. They don't need permanent majorities, because they remain in power continuously but take turns at the helm. The donors and institutions don't even take turns. That's how they rule. But yeah progressive intellectuals, tell us more about how the Dems need to start winning the hearts and minds of the electorate in order to "regain" power and totally crush their Republican enemies.
