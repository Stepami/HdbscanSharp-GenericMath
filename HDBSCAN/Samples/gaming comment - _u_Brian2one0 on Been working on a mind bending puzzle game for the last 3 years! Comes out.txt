/u/Brian2one0 on Been working on a mind bending puzzle game for the last 3 years! Comes out Nov 3
Making a game free with advertisements/non game changing microtransactions would be way better in terms of the money it will make. Something non intrusive like "watch this 20 second ad and get a chance to continue where you failed from" after a user fails would make you more money in the long run than having it be $3. You have to think, would a 12 year old spend $3 on the appstore to play the game, or would a 12 year old watch multiple ads over the course of a year to get things inside the game for free.
