[AMA Request] Anyone that has taken accredited cannabis courses in American Universities.
As a recent college graduate of Horticulture and Plant Pathology in a not so legal state, I have seen classes being offered at UC Davis, University of Vermont, and Ohio State University. I think its awesome that academics are considering the strides that cannabis is taking seriously in the states. It led me to try to look at options that are offered and if any of this information is on the web that was shared in these classes. I just thought it was the coolest thing so I figured I would put out a line and hope for a bite. Thanks in advance! My 5 Questions: How was the class atmosphere compared to your other biology/medicine courses you may have taken? What was the syllabus structure like? Is there anything you learned that cannot be found through independent research? Are there any notes/recordings/lectures that you would recommend online? What were the professors attitudes in teaching the material? Were they receptive to questions or just there to get the job done?
