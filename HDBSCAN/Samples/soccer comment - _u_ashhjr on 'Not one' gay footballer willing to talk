/u/ashhjr on 'Not one' gay footballer willing to talk - FA chairman Greg Clarke - "I haven't met one player at professional level who would agree to meet for a conversation over a cup of coffee. If they don't feel comfortable having that conversation, it doesn't say good things about our game."
Honestly. I've never met a gay person that was good at football tbh
