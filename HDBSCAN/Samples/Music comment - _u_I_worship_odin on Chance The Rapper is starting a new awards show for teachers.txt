/u/I_worship_odin on Chance The Rapper is starting a new awards show for teachers
The highest paid coach in Georgia is Jess Simpson of Buford High School ($174,107.65). Simpson has a record of 138-8 as Buford’s head coach and has multiple Georgia state titles. Simpson is the fourth highest paid district employee behind the superintendent, two principals and a director of curriculum. The second highest paid coach is Colquitt County High’s Rush Propst ($130,038.00). Both teach classes and neither serve as athletic director.  That's the important part here. My teacher at my high school taught girls basketball and was paid $115k. He also had taught there for decades and taught AP classes as well. I assume most high school coaches aren't just coaches but are also teachers at the same time.
