I'm Jude Brewer, author and podcast host of Storytellers Telling Stories. Ask me anything!
I like audio books and podcasts and those old radio shows where you could close your eyes and imagine the story playing out, using your imagination in the same way you would while reading a book. I'm also lucky to know so many interesting authors and poets, and so I thought I'd make it easier for everyone else to get to know them. So I created Storytellers Telling Stories, a literary "radio theatre" podcast, and the first episode went live yesterday. Storytellers Telling Stories was created to focus on what shapes our constructive discourse: point of view, narrative, community, and culture. Stories are how we jump into others’ lives and feel what they’re feeling. Our stories tell of raising children, falling in love, talking to the dead, protesting hatred, being objectified, falling out of love, and playing music in front of strangers. Im most interested in how you engaged with storytelling, if you've ever attended a live reading before, and what kinds of stories you would want to hear like this. Or what role has writing or reading played in your life? Ask me anything! Proof: https://twitter.com/judebrewery/status/915628060187140096  submitted by /u/judebrewer [link] [comments]
