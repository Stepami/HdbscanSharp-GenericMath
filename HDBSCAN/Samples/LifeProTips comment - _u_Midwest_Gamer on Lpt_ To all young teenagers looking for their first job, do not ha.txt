/u/Midwest_Gamer on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
Don't call every day asking if you get the job. Personally I hate even if you call me once, I understand it though "shows interest in the job etc etc" ps. It really doesn't, it's annoying as fuck.
