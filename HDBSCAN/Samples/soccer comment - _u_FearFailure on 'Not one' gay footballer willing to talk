/u/FearFailure on 'Not one' gay footballer willing to talk - FA chairman Greg Clarke - "I haven't met one player at professional level who would agree to meet for a conversation over a cup of coffee. If they don't feel comfortable having that conversation, it doesn't say good things about our game."
In many areas (the NFL, for example), it's simply given rise to a system in which the bodies of young black men generate huge amounts of income for wealthy white men, often at the expense of their educations and their long-term health.  I'm not sure this is "racism" so much as it is a non-diverse ownership class. If the NFL players were 99% white you'd be complaining that black athletes are underrepresented in the NFL, even though the "bodies of young [white] men" would be used to generate income for others "at the expense of their educations and their long-term health". I find it hard to pity NFL players who don't need to get educations because they are making millions by the time they finish school (just like I find it hard to pity white European footballers in the same situation).
