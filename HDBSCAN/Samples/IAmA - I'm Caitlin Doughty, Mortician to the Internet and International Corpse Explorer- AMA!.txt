I'm Caitlin Doughty, Mortician to the Internet and International Corpse Explorer- AMA!
It is I, Caitlin Doughty! I'm a mortician and I own a funeral home in Los Angeles, Undertaking LA. The last three years I've traveled the world looking at different death customs, and just released a new book From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death. You may know me from my webseries on death, Ask a Mortician or my last book, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes. I am here to take questions from my adoring crowd.... Hello? Anybody? SOMEONE ASK A QUESTION FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Proof: https://twitter.com/thegooddeath/status/915632997239418881  submitted by /u/CaitlinDoughty [link] [comments]
