/u/danielaschuster31 on When Clouds Break: the Hidden Dangers of Cloud Computing
Like so many other technology trends, cloud computing needs to go through the adolescence of "it's great for everybody." Technology has a lifespan that tends to keep to a similar curve: 1. Just released, early adopter geeks hop on. 2. Toddler-hood, initial bugs get worked out. 3. Childhood, getting more press, early adopter businesses go for it. 4. Adolescence, lots of press, lots of copying, lots of everybody's doing it. 5. Adulthood, stable, common technology, faults are now acknowledged but still a popular product. 6. Middle-age, having problems keeping up with new babies. Still stable and often a business staple. 7. Old-age, hard core fans hang on....everyone else heads to newer technology. A season for everything.
