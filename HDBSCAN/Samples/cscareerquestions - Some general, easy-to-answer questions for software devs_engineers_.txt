Some general, easy-to-answer questions for software devs/engineers.
I'll keep this short and sweet. I used to go to college for engineering, dropped out. Now, back in school some years later going for computer science. I am a new student at a small regional college. A couple of questions. 1) Small regional college (with great reputation) does not require any math higher than college algebra for a CS degree (other than discrete), is that strange? I feel like that's strange. Regardless, I already chose math as my minor since I have Calc 1 - Calc 3, diff eq and linear algebra from previous engineering college. But still, is that strange? 2) College doesn't have the greatest job fairs, so what other ways should I be looking for internships? Thanks!  submitted by /u/IICHASE55II [link] [comments]
