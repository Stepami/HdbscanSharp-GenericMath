/u/DownvotesForGood on Marijuana minimum age to be 18 in Alberta
Between an eighth and a quarter. From nothing but pure speculation it would make sense they divided the line between personal consumption and possible trafficing at that point. It's not an unreasonable line to draw either really. You can keep an 1/8th in a grinder and it's just yours and probably a couple days of smoke or enough for you and your buddy. If you're walking around with a 1/4 in your pocket...well you're probably not smoking a 1/4 to yourself. Not saying you can't, but it'd be slightly excessive from a moderate point of view.
