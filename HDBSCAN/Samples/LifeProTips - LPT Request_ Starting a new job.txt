LPT Request: Starting a new job
Greetings, LPT! I'll be starting a new job the first week of October (yay!) and this will be my second professional position. I've been at my current company for five years (first job fresh out of college) so it's been a while since I've been in this position. Last time, I was wet behind the ears and still learning office culture. This time, I'm in a senior role and ready to kick some marketing behind! What are your LPTs for making your first few days and weeks as helpful as possible? What do you wish you'd done the last time you'd started a new job?  submitted by /u/typhoonrosie [link] [comments]
