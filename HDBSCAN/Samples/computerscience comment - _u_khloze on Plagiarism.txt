/u/khloze on Plagiarism
Changing variable names absolutely cannot fool the machinewhen it comes to plagiarism detection. The thing is these names are always changed when your code is compiled anyway, so doing that won't change how his code will look identical to yours. Most of the plagiarism checking program happens to check a lot of different things ie. The order of function calls, how and where your program jumps between routines and so much more. If what happened is he stole or copied your code without permission, submitted it, and told you later, I'd suggest that you go straight to your professor and talked to him about this. Be honest with him. Most of the time they'll be a bit skeptical at first but once you can prove that he stole it from you then they'll be really helpful. However, if you kinda gave your code to your friend, then you're kinda out of luck here. I'd suggest that you man up and talk to your professor anyway. Tell him that you regret your decision. The key is to be HONEST here and your punishment would likely be lower than talking to them after getting caught (likely from being sent to the Dean right away to just get a 0 for this assignment).
