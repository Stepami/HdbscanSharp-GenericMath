/u/Chocolate_fly on LPT: Research charities before you donate; Some only end up giving a portion of your donation, and some people will just try to scam you.
This is a great TedTalk that really changed the way I think about giving to charity. Slightly off-topic in that I'm not saying "don't do research", but maybe giving to large organizations isn't such a bad thing, since they sometimes have a negative perception.
