Tifu by sitting next to a girl I thought was cute
So this is happening right now. As I walk into class I see a seat open next to girl I think is cute. As I take the seat I see a tissue on the seat, I think nothing of this and sit down. We start talking and we hit it of, I got her number and we decide to "study" later in the week. 10 minutes pass and my ass get cold so I start to sit in a different position cause I thought maybe I was cutting blood circulation off to my ass. I keep changing position but my ass is still cold so I finally touch the seat and realize it's wet. I finally move the tissue that was on the seat and throw it on the ground and see it's yellow. I'm currently hoping it's just yellow Gatorade that spilled on the seat and not piss. It might be fucking piss cause if Gatorade spilled on the seat would be sticky and it's not. I've got one more hr to go in this class before it's over and I don't wanna risk getting up and someone else coming and sitting in this piss seat because then everyone will think I pissed in it and left. Fml Tl;dr : sat in a piss filled seat cause I'm trynna smash  submitted by /u/LiberatedCappuccino [link] [comments]
