I'm a high school student from Australia and my project for my last year of school was to design my own Overwatch Character
Hello fellow redditors of the Overwatch community, I chose and completed this project for my year 12 subject, Visual Communication Design and my "fake" client was Blizzard. My goal was to design a character concept for the game Overwatch here is my final design! https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1om4K Information about my character: I created a female character, her name is Boomer (Trivia: Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men) Her name reflects her tomboyish personality! She is a defense hero, I revolved her abilities and kit around peeling allies and zoning enemies (As a support main I felt that Overwatch lacked a hero who could peel for their supports!). I based her theme around the Victorian Era, Steam Punk, the movie Mad Max and gained inspiration off Junkrat & Roadhog. In the future when I complete my course in Game Art & Animation I really hope to 3D model Boomer and animate her own highlight intros, emotes and etc!  submitted by /u/Blizzary [link] [comments]
