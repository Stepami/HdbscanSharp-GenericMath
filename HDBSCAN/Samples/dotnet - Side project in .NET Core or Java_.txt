Side project in .NET Core or Java?
I'm a .NET developer by trade and wrote a side project using .NET Core RC1 a while back. It was somewhat of a headache. I haven't touched that project in a good while at this point. I want to write another project and it needs to run on Linux. I know .NET Core 2.0 is out now and I am looking to use it. That said, I don't want to go through the hassle of living on the edge anymore and want something that just works. In addition, I don't want to waste time working with a technology that is going to die out because they maintainers can't decide what they actually want. Which brings me to Java. Java seems pretty stable, is basically the same language, is fast, has plenty of jobs, and runs on Linux. What do you think?  submitted by /u/foreverwantrepreneur [link] [comments]
