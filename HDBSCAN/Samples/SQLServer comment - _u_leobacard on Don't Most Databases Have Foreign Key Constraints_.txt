/u/leobacard on Don't Most Databases Have Foreign Key Constraints?
Most of the work I've done in the past decade has been implementing thirdparty databases and the majority of them either do not have FK's or have FK's but disabled ( which on SQL is frustrating since half the time I want to use TRUNCATE but can't because of the FK's). I've seen both sides. The best argument against came from an application designer who stated implementing FK functionality should occur at the business logic tier because that is where the most optimal use of development time is spent (vs FK's and handling exceptions). He had nothing against FK's and welcomed their usage but thought when it came to the final judgement data consistency is business logic and therefore be enforced at that tier. I would usually argue "implement once at database" but he would argue functionality was better placed at the business logic tier and easier to maintain there.
