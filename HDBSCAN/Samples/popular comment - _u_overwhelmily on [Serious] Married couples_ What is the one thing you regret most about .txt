/u/overwhelmily on [Serious] Married couples: What is the one thing you regret most about your wedding?
Maybe the ones you date. Even then, unless they’re outright saying “pay for me” you legitimately don’t even know that’s true. Go ahead. Claim they all do. Prove to the whole internet that women expect to be catered to by your own personal anecdotal completely unprovable “evidence.” Sorry you’ve had poor experiences, I guess?
