/u/lubbin604 on Who will be this seasons Matt Ryan?
They are NFL caliber WRs. But that's about it. Beasley is obviously the best of the bunch but they aren't elite weapons in any sense of the word. The only elite playmaker is Zeke, even Dez is borderline now because he has regressed so much and has constant injury issues. And it's going to be interesting to see how Dak plays without Zeke in the lineup. I personally don't think it's going to be pretty, all though i still think the Cowboys will sneak into a wildcard spot.
