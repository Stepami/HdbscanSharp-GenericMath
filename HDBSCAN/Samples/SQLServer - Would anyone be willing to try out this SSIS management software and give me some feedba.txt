Would anyone be willing to try out this SSIS management software and give me some feedback?
It was built on the idea that managing package executions kind of sucks. Data-Inator It allows the execution of packages across instances and versions in a single interface. It ties into the built-in event system to capture certain logging events of every package executed, which makes issue discovery/resolution much easier. It's built with a metadata driven variable system underneath so you can easily create reusable packages (I've even included a fair number of generic packages that can handle quite a few basic functions). I'm looking to get some feedback on the implementation. Any feedback is welcome. Thanks  submitted by /u/lazyFer [link] [comments]
