/u/aglioeoglio on No One Saw the Best Movies of 1997
Would it kill Vice to do just a little research? First off, Good Will Hunting was one of the top 10 highest grossing films that year, so was As Good as it Gets. Second, Tarantino in 1997 was not as well known and a sure-fire box office hitmaker as today, and Jackie Brown is the lowest grosser in his career. Then there's Boogie Nights, a great movie, but nobody knew who Paul Thomas Anderson was in 1997 and it's a bizarre film. Lastly, guess what topped the B.O. in 97? Titanic, the highest grossing film of all time which won over 10 Oscars. Who writes this garbage?
