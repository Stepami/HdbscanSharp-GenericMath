/u/bhutos on Candidate for Charlotte mayor puts 'white' among qualifications
I could say the same thing as it describes your reply. In fact it perfectly encapsulates the exact point of my comment. Zero content, heavy on implied accusations. It would be humorous if you intended it as a demonstration except I doubt you are that aware. shrugs. I'm in Australia and vote Green. I'm practically a communist by US standards. Your Democrats are more right wing than our right wingers. See what I had to do there? Assauge you that I'm probably further to the left than you are so you can think about putting down the snark? You couldn't have proved my point better without a power point presentation. Thank you.
