New PTR Patch Changes (Mercy,Junkrat,Genji)
Mercy- Res no longer resets after ulting, the cooldown stays at 30 seconds, the momentum from guardian angel is removed Junkrat- Tire is slower Genji- You seem to starts slashing faster. If Genji is stunned while winding up Dragonblade it still continues on rather than being completely wasted. It still immediately goes down to 0% ult charge upon pressing Q, just like every other ult in the game after the last patch. Apparently same thing with Lucio's and Soldier's ult. D.va - Your mech no longer just drops when using the new "hold to boost" option  These are all based on observations, I will update as I find more changes.  submitted by /u/Ilko962 [link] [comments]
