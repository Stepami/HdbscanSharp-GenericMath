Looking for an Azure master of sorts
So we are a quickly growing company and looking for someone who knows Azure inside and out as well as is possible and what is not possible. Also very technical and project orientated. This has been proven hard to find and while I have a lot of hosting support exp. and I am quickly learning all of Azure there is a lot of options Microsoft has pushed to the portal and as you know not all of them are fully fleshed out. While I know I could post a job position I like my fellow Redditors and thought what better way to get a discussion around where to find this type of person or if they all work for Microsoft only as it seems to be the case right now.  submitted by /u/caday40 [link] [comments]
