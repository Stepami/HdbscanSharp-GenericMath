/u/RichardSayre on Anyone watched the Middle?
We wouldn't be having this conversation if Malcolm in the Middle didn't have the success that it did. I didn't analyze the difference more because I didn't think I had to. Its obvious! Without Malcolm in the Middle you have no The Middle. They rode off MITM's success with a show that doesn't even try to hide the fact that they are coasting off of some else's achievement. It's kind of annoying that no one else will admit it.
