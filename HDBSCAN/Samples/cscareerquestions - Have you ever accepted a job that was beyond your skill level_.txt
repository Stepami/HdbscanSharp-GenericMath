Have you ever accepted a job that was beyond your skill level?
If so, what was your experience like? Did you overcome the challenge, and how? Or did you get crushed? Interested in hearing people's stories. I might soon be joining a team where the work is outside of what I'm capable right now, and am looking for inspiration.  submitted by /u/cppnewb [link] [comments]
