/u/PeanutButterYoJelly on What basic life skill were you surprised to find your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse didn't have when you first started dating?
I worked at a camp where we taught swimming, and actually the first step to teaching how to swim was just splashing water on the learner's face until he stopped panicking every time water was on his face. Next was getting the learner comfortable submerging his face in the water, which for younger kids especially we made a game out of (put on a snorkle mask in the shallow end and have the kids look for things at the bottom of the pool, especiqlly quarters). Floating on your back is absolutely essential for being able to swim. If you cannot do dead man's float, you'll be fighting yourself to swim every time. It's much harder for people with low fat content and high muscle content, so you shouldn't have as much difficulty is you classify yourself as "chubby." Best of luck!
