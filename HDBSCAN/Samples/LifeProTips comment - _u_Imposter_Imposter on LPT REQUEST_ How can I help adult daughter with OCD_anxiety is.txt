/u/Imposter_Imposter on LPT REQUEST: How can I help adult daughter with OCD/anxiety issues about North Korea?
You will read that the missile defence system has never actuality been tested in a true combat situation. If your daughter is anything like my girlfriend with OCD this minor detail would be enough for her to completely question the capabilities of the defence system and make her feel unsafe. If this does come up, look into the Israeli defence system. Its anti-missile and anti-rocket systems have been successfully used in a number of real combat instances. The Isreali's developed their system with the help of the US so it stands to reason that a lot of the technology in the proven Israeli system should be present in the US system as well. This should validate that the US system is reliable in a real-life emergency.
