/u/jeromehaynes on SQL Server 2014 to Azure blob storage - Picking up new databases
Hi taejim, Thanks for all your help. After looking at this and doing some testing...the big showstopper for this one is: " if a new database appears, but it's been created via a database restore or an attach statement, then it's already had a full backup, and will only get a differential (because, clearly, you have a full backup you used to restore it from originally). In this case, you either need more stringent requirements around who can restore databases onto your server, or only guarantee that you can recover the database after it's been there for a Saturday, or they inform you that a new full backup needs to be taken for that one database, or they supply you with the original backup file used to create the database." So this isn't a standard environment and a lot of the databases on there will have come from other servers...also lots of databases are going to be migrated to this server that will need full backups first thing. We also won't always know when a new database has been created due to the nature of the business and the environment. Is there no way of using change backup type and forcing it to run a full backup? Alternatively...There must be a flag or something somewhere that tells SQL server that it's been backed up before - is there any way of removing that? Any idea on this one? Would be greatly appreciated.
