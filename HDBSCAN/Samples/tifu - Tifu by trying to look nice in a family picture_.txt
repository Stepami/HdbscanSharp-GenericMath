Tifu by trying to look nice in a family picture.
This happened yesterday, but I didn't realize the consequences until today. I had to drive 6 hours by myself to pick up my sister. When I got to her house, she wanted to send my mom a picture showing us together (it had been awhile since I had seen my sister). I wanted to look nice in the pictures, because my mom would likely use it in the Christmas card this year and because I'm a little vain. I didn't have any lipstick, but I did have Cheetos Flamin' hot crunchy snacks from the gas station. I proceeded to put the powder on my lips. The pictures turned out quite nice, and it looks like I have a subtle red lipstick on. Flash forward to today. I woke up this morning to my lips BURNING! They are even more red than yesterday and now have blisters. I guess the Flamin' hot part burned my lips. It now hurts to smile. Tldr: my vanity (and Flamin' hot Cheetos) made me get a 2nd degree burn on my lips.  submitted by /u/Suz4 [link] [comments]
