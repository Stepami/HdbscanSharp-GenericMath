So... You wish to looks at a list of job titles: Marketing manager Marketing manager PA International Marketing Assistant International Contract Assistant And have the ML algorithm have access to some codes. Example: 1- Marketing 1.1 - Marketing Managers 1.2 - Marketing Staff 2 - Finance 2.1 - Domestic 2.2 - International 2.2.3 - Contracts And then have the algorithm match them based on what is semantically in the job title. To create this: 1.1-Marketing manager 1.2-Marketing manager PA 1.2-International Marketing Assistant 2.2.3-International Contract Assistant How many job titles do you have? You will honestly spend more time setting up and training a network, than just doing it by hand. Surely your company can;t have more than a few hundred? You could even do a large sift through another method to break down certainties and key words, and by eye check them.(Marketing, Director, Human Resources). If you are sure you want to use a ML algorithm, RNN is best for learning a more semantic meaning within a "sentence". Deep Learning is needed to "understand" the concepts of what words are the important ones. But... You would need a large training data set for a deeper network - maybe larger than that you have...?
