Heard this gem from a coworker yesterday
A man and his wife are out grocery shopping when the husband stops in beer section and gets a 24-pack for $10. The husband puts the 24-pack in the cart and his wife stops him and say "We can't get that, we have to stick to the budget!" so he puts it back on the shelf. Later on the wife stops in the cosmetics section and gets a container of face cream for $20. When she puts it in the cart, her husband stops her and says "We can't get that honey, it's not in the budget". The wife says "This face cream is what I use to look good!" The husband says "Well the beer makes you look good for half the price!"  submitted by /u/PM_ME_UR_GENITALIA_P [link] [comments]
