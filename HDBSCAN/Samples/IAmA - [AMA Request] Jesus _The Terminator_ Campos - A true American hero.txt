[AMA Request] Jesus "The Terminator" Campos - A true American hero
My 5 Questions: What were you thinking as you attempted to enter the room with an active shooter inside? Have you ever served in the military? What is the prognosis of the injuries that you suffered? How can the American public begin to thank you for your courage? Do you suffer from chronic back pain due to your balls being so big?   submitted by /u/PlausibleDeniabiliti [link] [comments]
