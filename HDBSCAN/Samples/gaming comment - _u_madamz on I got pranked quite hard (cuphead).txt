/u/madamz on I got pranked quite hard (cuphead)
There is 100% no way to know it could kill him, because it could interact with you, but you not with it.  That's bullshit. You're acting like the crushing attack is flat out IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID unless you already died to it once, when in fact the telegraphing of it is absurdly long. I can understand not getting the timing of the dodge perfectly right away, but to not even realize that the fight is still even going on? No way, that's 100% on the player.
