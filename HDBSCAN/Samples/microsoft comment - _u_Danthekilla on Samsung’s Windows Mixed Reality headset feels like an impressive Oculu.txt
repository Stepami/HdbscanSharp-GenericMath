/u/Danthekilla on Samsungâ€™s Windows Mixed Reality headset feels like an impressive Oculus Rift competitor
Oculus has sold 5% more than the vive. They made huge strides from their massive sale over the last 3-4 months. If you include the dk2 then they own around 54% of the global market. I wouldn't say they are market leaders in hardware sales however, it's too close to say that. But when it comes to software they are in a different league.
