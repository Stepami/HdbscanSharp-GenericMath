/u/Mike on We, designers, have failed
I'm always skeptical of "UI/UX Experts" who don't have any work samples of their own. There's so many out there. Here's his site http://willgrant.org/ and here's the company he apparently works for http://weared4.com/. Maybe there's more examples out there but why would I have to dig? Bad UX right? Both of those sites look just like cookie cutter standard website templates. I don't intend to be mean, I just think it's interesting how so many "experts" in our field don't have easy to find case studies of their own. Seems to be all talk.
