/u/lcc0612 on Plagiarism
As a former TA who has manually marked code, attempts to obscure plagiarism by students are usually fairly easy to see through. Changing variable names is the oldest trick in the book and that's almost never enough. Unless the assignment is really simple, you'll find that most students' approach are at least subtly different from each other, beyond shallow things like variable names. Of course, you can attempt to rely on the fact that if it was indeed hand-marked, your TA is probably on the verge of tears and not about to spot plagiarism unless it jumps out at them like a sore thumb. However, you're taking a risk there. I agree with the other commenters - Best to come clean early on than to risk it blowing up. And /u/khloze is right - If you did voluntarily show your code to your friend, part of the responsibility will unfortunately have to rest on your shoulders. You'll have to be prepared to get a 0 for the assignment. While that sounds bad, that's hardly the worst that could happen so I'm afraid it's better to be safe than sorry at this point. Good luck with this =)
