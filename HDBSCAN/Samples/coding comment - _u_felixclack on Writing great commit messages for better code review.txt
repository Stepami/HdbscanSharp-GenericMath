/u/felixclack on Writing great commit messages for better code review
Feels like this is one of those "no right way" issues where there are many approaches that work for people. The approach I wrote about is the result of observing the inline comment method too frequently becoming out-of-date and at times adding noise around the code and how I try and communicate the same information but in a way that helps the reader of the code. The beauty of putting that information into your commits is that you get a comment for every line of code in your project, that is always linked to a description of how it ended up there and doesn't go out of date. I appreciate the fact that it isn't directly visible until you run git blame can be the thing that puts people off but I like the fact that we can store a lot of extra info against a line of code without it becoming noise in our day-to-day working with the code.
