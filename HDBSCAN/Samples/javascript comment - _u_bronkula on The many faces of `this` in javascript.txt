/u/bronkula on The many faces of `this` in javascript
First of all, that link has nothing to do directly with Douglas Crockford. Secondly, the Douglas Crockford article that is actually linked therein is all about how not to misuse the new keyword. It has nothing to do with this. Also the article you linked was not actually telling people to not use this, it was an advertisement for their own zet.js library that wants to implement its own version of this called that actually further confusing the issue. So good luck with your not reading articles, or perhaps being the author of this shitty one.
