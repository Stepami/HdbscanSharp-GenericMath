/u/Badass_Bunny on Van der Sar: "When I left Ajax in 1999, I travelled to Liverpool and spoke to Houllier. I was shown around Anfield, met the chairman and a couple of players. I thought about it, but when Juventus came to the table I came to the conclusion that it would be a bigger challenge to play in Italy."
Nowdays it doesn't, however I wonder what the perception was back when Juventus signed a 22 year old GK for that amount of money?
