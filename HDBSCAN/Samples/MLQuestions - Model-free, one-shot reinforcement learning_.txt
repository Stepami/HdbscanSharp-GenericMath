Model-free, one-shot reinforcement learning?
If you had to build a real working system, let's say, for driving a car - but you only had one vehicle AND it's impossible to build a simulation, how would you go about building a reinforcement learning model to drive the car? For simplicity, let's say the action and observation space are pretty small (i.e. not driving an actual car, ignore that problem - I'm more curious about what the data collection/training approach would be when changing between different models, validating/backtesting, etc.) It seems the best way would be to collect as much data as possible while testing different models, and use some form of demonstration learning to be able to switch/change models, but I'm curious how people actually do this in practice when you don't have a simulation... or if it's been done.  submitted by /u/a394u30joi [link] [comments]
