/u/CGFarrell on Scientists can now produce electricity from tears
Are you trying to argue that harnessing piezoelectricity from crystallized lysozyme is in some way worthwhile? My point was "tears to electricity" is a click-bait claim. If you want electricity from tears, cry onto a turbine. Isolating and crystallizing lysozyme, and applying pressure to produce a feeble current is a stupid idea.
