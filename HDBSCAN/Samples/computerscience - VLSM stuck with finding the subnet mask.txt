VLSM stuck with finding the subnet mask
Hey guys, I'm pretty new to VLSM and I'm working through one of my first problems. For each network topology given, I'm trying to determine the network address, broadcast address, second usable IP, and the subnet mask in dotted decimal notation. I don't quite understand how to determine the subnet mask, or how to get from slash format to dotted decimal. Feel like I've been googling it for a little while now and I'm getting a sore head. Maybe I just need a break, but anyways, if anyone can explain it in ELI5 terms that would be amazing :) Here is an example of my problem: Main network address: 192.168.1.0/24 Subnet A: 41 hosts Subnet B: 88 hosts Subnet C: 12 hosts Subnet D: 12 hosts Subnet E: 2 hosts. Would I be correct in saying that the subnet mask for B is 255.255.255.128, A is 255.255.255.192, C is 255.255.255.208, D is 255.255.255.224 and E is 255.255.255.228? I just got those by adding 1 to the broadcast address for each, but don't know if that's correct. It feels wrong.. I know that B = /25 A = /26 C = /28 D = /28 E = /30 How do I get from the slash to 255.255. etc etc? Anyways, sorry if I rambled too much. Not sure how much info is actually needed for someone to help, so just chucked what I thought was needed in. Thanks for any help ! Edit: or if anyone has a link to a helpful website/example that would also be very welcome :) Edit 2: nerp, I took a break and came back to it. Figured it out.  submitted by /u/mellinade [link] [comments]
