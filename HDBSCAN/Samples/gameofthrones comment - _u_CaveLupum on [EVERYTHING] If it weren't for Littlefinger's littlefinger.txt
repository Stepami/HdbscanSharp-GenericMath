/u/CaveLupum on [EVERYTHING] If it weren't for Littlefinger's littlefinger
Yes, but she did nothing about it. She let him trail her around pouring advice and poison into her ear. He was egging on Royce and Glover to support Sansa taking over, so pretty soon his flattery and manipulation would have accomplished that.But Arya arrived and realized he was an enemy snake in her home. After the sparring where she tied Brienne, she gave him the 'death glare', and they plotted to kill each other via Sansa. He didn't know he was contending with a Faceless Man who had already used ploys to destroy a Kingsguard, another FM, and an entire House (twice!). They each stepped up the threat until Arya let Sansa know about the FM and silently gave her LF's dagger as a signal. When LF learned Arya was a FM, he immediately realized that wearing a Face, Arya could kill him any time. So he pushed hard for Sansa to kill Arya. And as Arya no doubt expected, he incriminated himself with false reasons. In a deleted scene Sansa got Bran to reveal LF's dossier. No wonder Sansa called Arya "the strongest person I know."
