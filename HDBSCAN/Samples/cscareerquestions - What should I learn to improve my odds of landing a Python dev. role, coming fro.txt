What should I learn to improve my odds of landing a Python dev. role, coming from a non-tech background?
Hi, the post is a bit long--hope you can bare with me. I come from a non-tech background and have been teaching myself development, mainly in Python, for the past couple years. I eventually hope to land a job doing Python dev. I've been looking at job posts more frequently recently, and the more I look, the more I am dismayed. I get the feeling that I've been teaching myself topics that are too scattered, too superficial, and not concentrating enough on a single area. Given my lack of a technical degree, what would help my odds of landing a job the most? As I learn more Python, I realize it's a language that excels, especially, in math and science and data analysis. This causes my main concern: I obviously won't land jobs in these fields due to my non-tech background--and that's okay, but what can I land a job in? I started with Django for web dev., but learned soon that I'm not a huge fan of it. So I started scripting and learned that I enjoy making small scripts that involve scraping and automation, doing basic analysis(on topics like sports) using Jupyter Notebook and bs4, building basic bots, etc. But these are incredibly low-level(essentially hobbies) and I don't see any job postings that really seek these skills. So my question is: what'll help me the most in landing a Python dev. role? Should I suck it up and return to web-dev with Django? Is there an area in the industry for script-making and the like? Would it help if a guy like myself learned proper programming principles(data structures & algos) to go for the "legitimate" programming jobs? Advice much appreciated.  submitted by /u/checkYourCalendar [link] [comments]
