LPT: If you grind your own hamburger, put a slice a bread through at the end, it helps clean the grinder and works as binder for the hamburger.
My mom taught me that one. You can also toss in garlic cloves or onion to flavor the hamburger. Chuck roast goes on better sales than hamburger a lot of times.  submitted by /u/Callmedory [link] [comments]
