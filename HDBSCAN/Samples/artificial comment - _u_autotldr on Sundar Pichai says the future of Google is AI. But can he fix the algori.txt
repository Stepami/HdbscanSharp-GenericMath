/u/autotldr on Sundar Pichai says the future of Google is AI. But can he fix the algorithm?
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 91%. (I'm a bot) Unbeknownst to me, at the very moment on Monday morning when I was asking Google CEO Sundar Pichai about the biggest ethical concern for AI today, Google's algorithms were promoting misinformation about the Las Vegas shooting. When the subject isn't the failure of its news algorithms, Pichai is enthusiastic about AI. There's not much difference between an enthusiastic Sundar Pichai and a quiet, thoughtful Sundar Pichai, but you get a sense of it when he names a half-dozen Google products that have been improved by its deep learning systems off the top of his head. Google's lead in doing clever, innovative things with AI is impressive, and the examples Pichai cites can sometimes even verge on inspiring - but there's clearly still work to do. During our conversation about getting things right in search, I press Pichai on the fact that Google is beginning to offer feeds of content in the Google app.  Extended Summary | FAQ | Feedback | Top keywords: Google#1 Pichai#2 think#3 thing#4 product#5
