/u/voronaam on Agile Software Development and Scrum - Heaven or Hell?
One thing I do not get about agile prophets is their total lack of waterfall knowledge. The main problem here is that Waterfall has no feedback loop.  A badly designed waterfall my not have it, but a properly designed one will. A proper one should have gates - a scheduled check-up with a customer to show the current state. It also has baked in time to make the adjustments. You may even have a waterfall process with a weekly check up with the client, just like if you had week long sprints. If you want to talk about how Agile is better than Waterfall, at least take some time to learn about it. P.S. Agile is better for software projects 9 times out of 10. But when it is not right, it is a disaster. People should learn to recognize those projects and user the proper tool. Hint, agile-disaster projects often include multilple hard deadlines, and fairly tight ones.
