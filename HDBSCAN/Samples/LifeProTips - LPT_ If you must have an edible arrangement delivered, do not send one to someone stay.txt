LPT: If you must have an edible arrangement delivered, do not send one to someone staying in the hospital.
First of all, you're assuming they have a refrigerator to store it. Second, the staff will have to take time from patient care to take the thing apart, place it into baggies, and make sure the patient doesn't forget it. Third, it's extra unsanitary to have open to the air fruit walked through a hospital. A loose plastic wrap is not protecting anything. Y'all wouldn't believe how much this happens.  submitted by /u/irish_tiger [link] [comments]
