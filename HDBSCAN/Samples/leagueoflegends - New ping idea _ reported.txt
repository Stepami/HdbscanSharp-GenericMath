New ping idea : reported
I am fed up of the amounted of times I have to type reported. we should have one last ping , reported. The amount of time this would save me when my support doesn't tower dive with me at level 3 would help no end. I want this to be similar to previous pings but with slightly more feedback for the offender. I want the report to be in yasuo's voice as he requires more skill than your champ. Maybe teemos? Some level of screen blur or shake every time my master yi fails to level 3 gank me would be a positive move. I feel this would certainly help me get through bronze and increase the views on my yasuo montage videos that I make with dragon force background music. Any artistic impressions of said ping are welcome but mine will be better. Cheers  submitted by /u/mrkin92 [link] [comments]
