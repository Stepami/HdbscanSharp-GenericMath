[AMA Request] Someone who was at the Beatles Performance of "Hey Jude"
My 5 Questions: How did you get to be in the video? Did you get paid for it? Did you get to meet all the Beatles, if not, who did you meet? Were there any rules for what you could or couldn't do while signing the chorus? Was it the only Beatles related thing you ever did?
