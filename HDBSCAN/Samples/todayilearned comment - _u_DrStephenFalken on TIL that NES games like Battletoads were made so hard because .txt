/u/DrStephenFalken on TIL that NES games like Battletoads were made so hard because Nintendo was losing money on video game rentals. If they took a long time to beat, people would have to buy the games instead.
Great post. I'd like to add a 5th reason now. Your post just made me think of something with your mention of development time. A lot of companies didn't want to spend time making great games or even good games because the game market crashed once. So they thought it was a toy fad that would die out and they were out to make their buck while they could. Hence the reason that majority of NES games are licensed hot garbage and I say that as a life long gamer there loves NES and grew up on one.
