/u/CyberByte on Training enviroment for "director class" game AI implementations ?
For better or for worse, "game AI" is often seen as somewhat separate from "AI", so you may also want to try your luck in /r/gameai or /r/gamedev. OpenAI Gym basically provides an interface that allows you to somewhat decouple the implementation of the agent and the environment. So if you create a learning algorithm capable of acting in multiple environments, you only have to code a Gym-compatible version once, and you can test it out in all Gym-compatible environments. And vice-versa, you could test one environment with different agents. Both Gym and Universe offer a fairly large set of environments that you could test your AI in. However, I don't know if any of them are "director games" (you'd have to look), and if you have to make your own game and you're going to write AIs that can pretty much only interact with that game, then the value of using Gym/Universe is somewhat limited. It's still not a bad idea if your AI can easily be adapted to other environments, or if you want to make it easy for other people to create AIs for your game, but that's up to you. To avoid having to code a whole game, you might also want to look for games with a director AI and see if it's possible to somehow alter it (e.g. if it's open source or if you can create mods).
