Is it worth the risk to have some aspect of your political beliefs indirectly attached to your resume?
I'm tempted to include some hobby project(s) on my resume that are political-ish. (i.e. Rah rah 1st Amendment kind of projects ) Part of it is because its eating into my non-work programming time so my "real" github hasn't really had much activity in years beyond a couple small repos. Part of it is, honestly, hiding my political beliefs gets tiring after awhile. I don't plan to run around shouting it to the world but a few github repos labeled "1st_Amendment_Site" would make it look less bare and show some side projects used by actual human beings. Obviously, I don't endorse what people are saying that aren't me but at the same time I'm enabling them to say it. I could rename it something "generic" sounding but anyone who googled bits and pieces of it would figure it out pretty quickly given the repo is the operational site. It isn't like I allow people to post non-political pornography, etc. But they probably will have some pics of topless marches if one happened recently. So the question is...how much would this hurt me career wise on a scale of 1 to 10? And do you think that would hurt me less than an empty github and unexplained resume gaps papered over with half-truths?  submitted by /u/AlexanderNigma [link] [comments]
