Hell you can even look up the salary information for minor public employees in Minnesota. I would guess it's similar in other states. It's your tax dollars (if you live there of course), you're allowed to have some level of oversight in where those dollars are going. You could complain to your elected officials if you felt that certain salaries were too high. ... not sure where that'd get you ultimately...but you could.
