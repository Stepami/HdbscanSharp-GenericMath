/u/CSI_Tech_Dept on PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL 10 Released
I read that link. I didn't see anything broken there. The default replication format was statement-based format at the time it made sense (but there was still the other options). Now row-based format is the default. Yeah, the impact of the trade-offs changed. I don't see what's the problem.  The problem is that in Postgres you just have one replication, you set it up and it works as expected. No need to pick up trade offs or worry which commands are safe to use. First of all MySQL didn't implement that feature just to put a mark. It was a problem they needed to solve. Second, are we going to ignore a lot of things PostgreSQL got wrong now? One process per query and one thread per process, crappy implementation of CTEs  That's just implementation issue, when these kind of issues are fixed you just use newer version and things work. The issues in MySQL are design issues. With replication now you have multiple modes, one which is obviously broken. When accessing the database in MySQL you have silent type coercion which might cause loss of data, the solution is to guess what the correct sql mode should be and define it etc. the MONEY type  I'm not sure what the problem is. Do you mean that you also can use NUMERIC? materialized views letc.  I'm not sure again what problem with materialized view is. Do you mean that it was lacking concurrent operation or that it doesn't update automatically when tables are modified? Again issues are either solved or can be solved without requiring developer to use crutches like sql_mode, utf8mb4 etc. It is just missed functionality that can be added in later versions without re-architecting the solution.
