/u/DaveTheHungry on Doesn't the new lootbox system basically screw over new players?
Yeah I started during the summer games and I really wanted the Nike Mercy skin. I was about 500 coins short and went on to buy 24 loot boxes ($20) and was still short on coins. I finally got the skin after playing arcade and leveling up 7 loot boxes later. Definitely gonna be saving up on coins for the Halloween event.
