/u/IAmAnOzzieNewsomeGuy on Universal Moves Ninth ‘Fast and Furious’ Movie Back a Year to 2020
It is also easy to see why this potential animosity will exist if Universal goes with the "spin-off" for Hobbs and Shaw. Not only are Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham late additions to the original, core cast in these movies, their characters are by far the only interesting ones left, at this point, in the franchise. The Rock is the biggest name in Hollywood; he single-handedly jump-started his resurgence with Fast Five and, in the process, his star power turned the Fast & Furious franchise into one of the highest-grossing series. Statham, himself, also has a huge following by being one of the top action stars, today. What do Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris even currently have besides the Fast & Furious franchise? It's also not the 2000s, any more, where Michelle Rodriguez is the lone/go-to "tough chick". Heck, even Vin Diesel, now 50 years, is badly starting to feel and look too old to play a character like Dominic Toretto. Plus, as you said, enough with tying these over-the-top adventures with "muh family". If Universal goes with that spin-off idea and it ends-up as much of a commercial success as Fate of the Furious was with just Rock and Statham (HINT: It will.) , why would the studio even need to try and do another "team-up" movie with additional characters that only drag the movie? Tyrese very well knows a Hobbs/Shaw spin-off will only finish off his lone consistent, big-blockbuster gig.
