LPT: Get Netflix or other services without giving them your credit card info
I hate putting in a credit card number for Netflix or other, similar services for them to automatically deduct from my account. Instead, I buy myself Netflix gift cards, then when signing up, all I have to enter is the gift card pin. I bought myself $150 in gift cards, and boom! Netflix for about a year without having to enter my credit card. I haven't used it anywhere but Netflix, but I'm sure there's other services that it would work for. You just make it a gift for yourself instead of someone else.  submitted by /u/chrisimac [link] [comments]
