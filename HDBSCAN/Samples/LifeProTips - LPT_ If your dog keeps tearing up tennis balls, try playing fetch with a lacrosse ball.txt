LPT: If your dog keeps tearing up tennis balls, try playing fetch with a lacrosse ball
My roommates lab/shepherd mix is absolutely fixated on chasing a ball but he always tears up the tennis balls we use, plus they get disgusting to throw without a thrower. We recently dropped a lacrosse ball and he got a hold of that and loves it, It's more resilient and doesn't get as gross! Although I wouldn't throw it where they can catch it, the ball is pretty dense so it's better that they chase it.  submitted by /u/Abeis [link] [comments]
