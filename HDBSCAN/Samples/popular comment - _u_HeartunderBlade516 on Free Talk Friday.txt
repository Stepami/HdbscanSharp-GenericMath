Had my first interview today. Felt that everything was going great until I got hit with one specific question. Did research before and its listed that they do audit public companies. Interviewer asked me “What made you decide to pursue a position in auditing public co, as opposed to smaller corp’s”. Explained that I’ve always been interested in large companies because public co’s have such an effect on society as a whole. What better way to have a deeper understanding of them then to be able to have a deep understanding of their financial statements. Interviewer responded with “oh but we mostly work with small private companies is that ok with you?” Felt like I fucked this one up :l
