Today's games have been absolutely amazing
Second day of worlds, but holy have there been a lot of hectic games. I don't even know who is gonna end up winning the next so-close game EDG vs SKT, but I've been on the edge of my chair since the start of the broadcast 6 hours ago.  submitted by /u/HabboTrax4Ever [link] [comments]
