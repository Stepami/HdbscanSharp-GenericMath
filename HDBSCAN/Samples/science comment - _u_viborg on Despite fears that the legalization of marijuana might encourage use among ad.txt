/u/viborg on Despite fears that the legalization of marijuana might encourage use among adolescents, the rate of marijuana use among teenagers has dropped to its lowest point since 1994, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Do you have any evidence for your claims about either marijuana or alcohol? I tried searching but couldn't find much. It isn't borne out by what I've observed. Medical marijuana in California increased availability of the drug at the street level, and I haven't seen any evidence that illegal dealers have some newfound concern about the age of their customers. Similarly the legal drinking age didn't stop basically everyone at my high school from binge drinking on the weekends. I suspect it's more accurate to say that the decrease in marijuana use is probably increased to use of other and more dangerous drugs, most likely either "club drugs" (eg MDMA) prescription pharmaceuticals.
