Ethernet Diagram Help!
Hello, This post is more of a data communications type of thing, but I am really looking for some help here. I am fairly new to computer networking and I am having some trouble. I need to create an ethernet diagram for the second floor of a building that holds 50 employees and is connected to the other networks on each floor (3 floors total) using a switch. I don't know how many desktops a single switch can hold and all those logistics, so I really don't even know where to begin. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.  submitted by /u/mimi_mae [link] [comments]
