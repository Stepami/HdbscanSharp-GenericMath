Video player with multiple layers?
I'm not sure if this is something that exists out there, but perhaps I'm been searching with the wrong keywords. Basically, what I'm looking for is a video player that would allow to play content but also allow a secondary overlay video to be turned on. The idea being that, for example, for instructional purposes, I might want a video explaining a certain process with a limited amount of the solution presented visually, but if the person is having a hard time following, they can click a button to overlay an additional video that has more of the solution presented visually (the secondary video has no audio -- it just shows more than would otherwise be shown; most of the secondary layer would just be transparent).  submitted by /u/JustinRandoh [link] [comments]
