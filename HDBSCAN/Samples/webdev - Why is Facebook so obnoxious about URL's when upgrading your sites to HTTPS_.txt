Why is Facebook so obnoxious about URL's when upgrading your sites to HTTPS?
We need to update a bunch of social media oriented sites with a cubic ton of likes and shares to HTTPS and it would be pretty easy if not for Facebook and their idiotic crawler. Every index out there will respect your HTTP 302 Permanent redirects on canonical URL's and update their data accordingly. But not Facebook, they will gladly drop all likes and shares if you don't treat their crawler as some special snowflake. Which basically means we can't ever fully move to HTTPS and always need to keep the HTTP door half open for anything that self identifies as facebookexternalhit. We now have to mess about with rules and complexity in nginx, Varnish and CloudFront Lambda's and implement, test and maintain a bunch of security measures just for this nonsense, as if we don't have better things to do.  submitted by /u/flitsmasterfred [link] [comments]
