Best and most efficient way to read this kind of element from an XML file
Hi all! Before I start, I am using ASP.NET MVC5 with Razor pages in Visual Studio. I'm looking for the most efficient and less complicated way to read this kind of element: I have a Site object with two attributes: Name (string) & Codes (List)  They represent different sites (cities) and the location codes we use for servers or network devices naming. This is what the XML could look like:    Ottawa   OTT1 OTT2      Vancouver   VAN1        Before having the possibility of multiples codes, I used this code (they all had only one site code each):  string xmlPath = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/App_Data/sites.xml"); XDocument xml = XDocument.Load(xmlPath); var sites = (from s in xml.Descendants("Site") select new SiteViewModel { Name = (string)s.Element("Name"), Code = (string)s.Element("Code") }).ToList();  I know HOW I could go and do it, but I'd like to know the BEST way and MOST EFFICIENT/SIMPLE way to do it! If it can just be by editing that one line that used to get the Element("Code") , that would be great! Thank you all very much! :)  submitted by /u/JimboAinzley [link] [comments]
