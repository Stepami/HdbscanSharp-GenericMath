SharpDX SwapEffect and Form transparency
I'm using SharpDX to create a simple fps overlay with a transparent background using a RenderForm.     Everything is fine when I use SwapEffect.Discard in my swap chain description. When I switch to SwapEffect.FlipSequential, the fps increases, but I lose the transparent background.     I've tried using different formats in the mode description, using the Transparent window style, but nothing seems to give me the same behavior. On windows 7, flip sequential maintains the transparent background using the same code.   Is there anyway to keep the transparent background and use the FlipSequential swap effect on Windows 10? The way I understand it, and from my own testing, FlipSequential provides better performance.    I'm using Windows 10, 4790K, 1070 GPU.      ///  /// Create the swap chain that we'll use to present our drawings to our render target ///   ///  ///   private static SwapChainDescription CreateSwapChainDesc(RenderForm form) { var swapChainDesc = new SwapChainDescription() { BufferCount = 2, Usage = Usage.BackBuffer | Usage.RenderTargetOutput , OutputHandle = form.Handle, IsWindowed = false, ModeDescription = new ModeDescription(0, 0, new Rational(144, 1), Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm), SampleDescription = new SampleDescription(1, 0), Flags = SwapChainFlags.AllowModeSwitch, SwapEffect = SwapEffect.FlipSequential }; return swapChainDesc; }   submitted by /u/TheFlankenstein [link] [comments]
