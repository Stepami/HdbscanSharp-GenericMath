/u/laughingstoc on [Serious] In honor of Pregnancy/Infant Loss Awareness month: Men of Reddit who have experienced pregnancy or infant loss with your partner, what resources do you wish had been made more available to you, and how could your friends and family been better supports for you and your partner?
My friend and her husband first baby was stillborn at 29 weeks. This was 11 years and still they are both grieving. My friend had a completely healthy pregnancy and then stopped feeling the baby move. I don't know if it was denial but she mentioned it to someone in work that it had been about 36 hours since she had felt anything and I still remember the conversation my co-worker had with her to this day. Another thing that really sticks in my mind is that at the funeral everybody gathered at the graveside and my friend was with her family and friends and her husband was with his mum and dad- just the three of them. It really stuck in my mind that everybody was so focused at the time on my friend that her husband was kind of forgotten. His extended family and friends just stood back. I'm not knocking them by any means. The volume of grief that day was unbearable and I don't think people knew what to do or say when you are faced with a tiny coffin. They are quite open about their loss and talk about their daughter but the support they received from the hospital at the time was poor and only compounded to their grief. They weren't really offered any outside support just given leaflets from organisations and no follow up. The hospital does have a fairly poor reputation though. What I will say though is that on the anniversary I always send my friend a message to let her know I'm thinking of her but I also send her husband a separate one as well as does several of mutual friends.
