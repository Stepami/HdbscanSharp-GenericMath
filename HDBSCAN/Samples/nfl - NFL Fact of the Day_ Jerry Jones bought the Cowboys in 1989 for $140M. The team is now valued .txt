NFL Fact of the Day: Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140M. The team is now valued at $4.2B, which means Jones has received a 2900% return on investment (ROI)
In 1989, Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys for $140M dollars (roughly $276M in 2017 dollars). In 2017, Forbes magazine rated the Cowboys the most valuable sports team in the world at $4.2B dollars, which is a cool $500M more than the Yankees are valued. Just how good an ROI did Jones get on the team? 2900%, which, is pretty solid. For context, had Jones invested that same amount in an S&P 500 index fund in 1989, his investment would have returned him 674%. I'd say he's set for life.
