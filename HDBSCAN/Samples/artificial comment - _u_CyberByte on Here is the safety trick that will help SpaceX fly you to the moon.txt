/u/CyberByte on Here is the safety trick that will help SpaceX fly you to the moon
Thank you /u/dearpetra for your contribution to the subreddit! This article is about the fact that SpaceX automated part of their rocket safety systems. It talks about the benefits of this technology, but doesn't really say anything about how it works. I'm sure there's AI in there somewhere (for some definition of AI), but I wonder if it's enough for /r/artificial. I'd like to hear from our visitors if you think if /r/artificial's mods should approve or delete this kind of content in the future (or if I'm an idiot for even wondering about this). Thanks for your feedback! Also, people who like this may also like /r/Automate.
