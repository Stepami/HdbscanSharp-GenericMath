/u/Galle_ on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’
Not to mention she also had new TShirts printed with political messages during this crisis.  This is the argument I was joking about above: She was wearing a t-shirt telling people to send aid to Puerto Rico, which proves that she could afford a t-shirt, which proves that she's doing nothing to help Puerto Rico!  I had to include an "/actual Trumpet argument" at the end because otherwise nobody would actually believe that you guys genuinely said such idiotic shit.
