/u/itsdabin on LPT: If you are riding a bike, ride with traffic. If you are walking, always walk on the sidewalk; if there is no sidewalk, walk against traffic.
We get an (sort of) cycling exam when were about 11 (at least at my school) which teaches the basics of traffic rules. Is really usefull to do everywhere imo
