MigAz copy issue
anyone seen this? been using MigAz to move VMs from ASM to ARM within the same subscription. Did one yesterday with no errors ... but today i'm getting an error using one of the PS commands: "Get-AzureStorageBlobCopyState : The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden. HTTP Status Code: 403 - HTTP Error Message: This request is not authorized to perform this operation using this source IP [redacted]. the only difference i can see between my successful server move yesterday and the one today is that today's server(s) are Stopped(Deallocated) in Azure. Does anyone know if we can move resources in this state using MigAz?  submitted by /u/jjkrri [link] [comments]
