Booth Review (Week 5, TNF game)
Hello /r/nfl and welcome to the Booth Review. Now that you've had the night to digest yesterday's game let's take a look under the hood and review. Please post all thoughts/opinions/analyses here regarding to the X's and O's, strategy discussion, scheming, etc. We'd like every comment to have some thought behind it and low effort comments/memes/etc. will be removed. Comments aren't required to be long write-ups or full game breakdowns, but any thoughtful takeaway from each game are welcome.  submitted by /u/NFL_Mod [link] [comments]
