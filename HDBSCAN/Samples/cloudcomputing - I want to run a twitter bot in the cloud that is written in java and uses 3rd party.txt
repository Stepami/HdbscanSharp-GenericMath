I want to run a twitter bot in the cloud that is written in java and uses 3rd party libraries. What are my options?
Obviously I'd like to pay as little as possible if at all because it's a very very light app that I want to run. I could always just have it run on my desktop but what's the fun in that. I've tried google app engine but honestly a lot of the stuff is way over my head. Any help is appreciated!  submitted by /u/usernamed_ [link] [comments]
