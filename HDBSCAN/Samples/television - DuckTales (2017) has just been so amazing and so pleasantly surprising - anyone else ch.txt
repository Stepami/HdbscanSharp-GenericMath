DuckTales (2017) has just been so amazing and so pleasantly surprising - anyone else check it out and have any thoughts?
The first episode 44-minute special is free on Youtube if anyone wants to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP0Neif7Y4E Even though the children were a little annoying in the beginning, after 4 episodes, I'm starting to really warm up to the children, the duck family, and the other characters like Webby. The show has so much heart in my opinion, and I really love it for that. It seems to have a plan for a plot too - I can already see foreshadowing on the wall for future plot points and potential enemies, and the animation, sounds, music, and characters are just such a joy to watch. Of the shows I've watched this year, its the biggest and most pleasant surprise. Part of me even wants to try out the older version before this reboot because of how good this series is. Any other thoughts on it?  submitted by /u/storygamer88 [link] [comments]
