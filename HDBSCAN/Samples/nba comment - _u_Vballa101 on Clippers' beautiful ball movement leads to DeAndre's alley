/u/Vballa101 on Clippers' beautiful ball movement leads to DeAndre's alley-oop slam
Yeah, that's what I expected, you can't even admit what team you follow. Forgive me for not taking your opinion seriously when you invent stories on the fly, and boldly state your claim about a player who you can't even be bothered to watch on the court. Half decent attempt at trolling, I should have known just from looking at your username.
