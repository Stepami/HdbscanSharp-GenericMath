Olympic Gold Medalist & 4 time X Games Gold Medalist...Ask Maddie Bowman anything now!
My name is Maddie! Some people know me as a halfpipe skier who has had a pretty successful career winning the Olympics in Sochi in 2014, winning 4 X Games Golds, and winning some World Cups and Dew Tours along the way as well! I also am the host of an event called Recess, which is an event (not a competition) that allows women skiers and snowboarders to express themselves and progress their skiing. Take a look with this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3LD0RaY4XY I truly love skiing and how it allows me to be who I truly am! And then some people know me as a college student, a sister, a mountain biker, a cat and dog lover (you can be both), and an activity addict! So feel free to ask me anything about whatever you want!

GREAT CHATTING WITH YOU.  submitted by /u/Maddie_Bowman [link] [comments]
