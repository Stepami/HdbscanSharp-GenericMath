/u/davidbyrnebigsuit on [Bill Simmons on Ringer NBA Podcast] This is what I hate, I really hope on the Internet somebody is not just gonna clip one piece of this and then put it on the fucking NBA Reddit. Fuck you if you do that, listen to the whole conversation. (Whole conversation included)
I mean there was a post the other day where somebody had stats for NBA range 3's for a few top prospects and Fultz shot something like 20%, albeit on a pretty small number of attempts. Maybe they were worried about his ability to hit from NBA range.
