Async All the Way Down
Typical contrived example to show what I'm trying to get across: https://pastebin.com/PnmV6paH I've read a lot that you should not mark a method as async if you don't need to, but all things considered, the overhead is not enough to worry about it. In the example pastebin, is there really any difference? Instead of overcomplicating code, should you just async all the way down and not really worry about it? Reference: https://blog.stephencleary.com/2016/12/eliding-async-await.html In the above reference, my example would be an obvious case of "pass through". But in production code when things might be a little hairy, I feel like it's not enough to freak out about. If I understand everything correctly, the performance gain is negligible.  submitted by /u/paleofwind [link] [comments]
