/u/oneoutof4 on If you had 8 hours a day to study and prepare for interviews, how would you structure each day?
How many days do you have until the interviews? If it was within the next month or two, I'd spend half the time reading and doing exercises from books on the subject (e.g., CTCI), and the other half doing online coding contests. If you're planning to apply for jobs that require specific expertise, then also spend time becoming more of an expert in those areas. If it's farther off, then that gives time to create cool new projects, build on your github, read books that give you better fundamentals (e.g., art of comp programming), etc.
