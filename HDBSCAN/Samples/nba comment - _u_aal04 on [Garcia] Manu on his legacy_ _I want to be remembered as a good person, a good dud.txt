/u/aal04 on [Garcia] Manu on his legacy: "I want to be remembered as a good person, a good dude, that I was around in town, fun to watch. But after a few years it'll be forgotten. The legacy thing is very overrated. If you live your life thinking about legacy or what you'll leave, then you add another concern."
You are wrong Manu. I will still remember how you played and carried yourself off the court. Legend
