/u/_0x0_ on Why did you turn outlook/hotmail into Gmail clone?
Thanks, I just went ahead and created a new profile, and it seems to be working fine. I've seen windows update cause problems with Outlook too, but I don't know if that's what it was last time. I don't use antivirus and I don't know if we can even completely disable the windows defender. I don't use carbonite, I use dropbox but it is not syncing the pst/ost directories. Hardware seems to be OK but it doesn't hurt to run a thorough hard drive check (thinkpad checks it regularly but I don't know how thorough it is with error checking) It's an SSD so I doubt that's an issue. Thanks for the suggestions.
