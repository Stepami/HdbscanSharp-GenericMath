/u/vnwk_1 on Any suggestions to make the mix of colors of this web app a little more modern? I am required to change "only" the colors.
You're welcome! :) And yeah that's the biggest challenge, specially since you can only change colors. But at least try some colors from those, and see how they work with it, good thing is, you can do that straight in the browser :D
