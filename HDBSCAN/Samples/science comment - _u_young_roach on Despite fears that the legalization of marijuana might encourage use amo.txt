/u/young_roach on Despite fears that the legalization of marijuana might encourage use among adolescents, the rate of marijuana use among teenagers has dropped to its lowest point since 1994, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Am a teenager who lives in the suburbs of Chicago. It might just be the rap influence around here but basically everyone “popular” smokes weed. My boyfriend and I were just saying that almost everyone we know from school smokes weed at this point. I know I don’t speak for every teenager but I go to a school with almost 3,000 students and most of them have tried weed at least once from what i’ve heard.
