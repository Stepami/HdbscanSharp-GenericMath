DQS Knowledge Base, term-based relations regexp
I'm creating a knowledge base for a DQS project. The data contains numbers (string format), some of which are suffixed by letters. I want to remove the letters and keep the numbers. I figure i can do this by using term-based relations. But what I do not know is if I can use regexp when setting up the term-based corrections and if the data that i want to correct have to be included in the domain to get this to work. If so, what regexp would i use to remove any letter (not convert it to a blank space?  submitted by /u/leiftheneat [link] [comments]
