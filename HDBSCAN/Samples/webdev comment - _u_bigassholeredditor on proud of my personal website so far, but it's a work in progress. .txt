/u/bigassholeredditor on proud of my personal website so far, but it's a work in progress. need any and all feedback i can get!!
Feel free to disregard as it appears like I'm the minority here, but I really don't like it. 1) Flipping circles is gimmicky, doesn't look good, and is reminiscent of annoying 90s era geocities animated gifs. https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--QwpfQtQS--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/ccmvpoupua8fxr3inrgc.gif 2) One of your gimmicky circles highlights responsive, yet your site performs like dog balls when you actually resize it (the 3 circles wrap, then as you get smaller, go back to being 3 on a line, then wrap again, then ultimately looking like shit on small screens). 3) Cartoon faces, Nothing says unprofessional like people who either make or pay for cartoon versions of their faces. Nobody gives a shit what your fursona is, or your bitstrips. Unless you're some kind of public figure, I really don't see the need to include even real pictures of yourself. 4) Your portfolio is awful. http://robison-mechanical.com/ - Using HTML tags to resize images on the portfolio page here is ick, the entire site looks like it was made in frontpage 10 years ago. 5) favicon and cartoony winking face things make it look like it was made by a child.
