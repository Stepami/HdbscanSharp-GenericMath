/u/PigNamedBenis on [AMA Request] Elon Musk
If I were a billionaire, I would invest a couple hundred thou here and there into companies like that, come to shareholder meetings and ask questions like this to troll them. Of course Elon doesn't want to be rude and tell him (rightfully) to stfu because he's sucking shareholder dick.
