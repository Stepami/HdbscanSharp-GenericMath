is it for me if i dont really want to learn at home, only at work? and that i am someone who likes to go at 80% speed instead of 110% ?! Hello all, I am a pretty laid back perosn, and i like to take my time while working, or working in short burst with some break between. I don't rly like being stress or having deadline ( or if i have a deadline i like to know that i have plenty of time to achieve it.) Also my life at home is not for work, its for friends girlfriends, tv, sports, etc. so I do not intend to learn a lot at home, mostly all from work Is it still a good career for me? or should I just abandon this idea now?!  submitted by /u/num2007 [link] [comments]
