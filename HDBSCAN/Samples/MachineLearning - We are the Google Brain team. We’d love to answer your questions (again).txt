We are the Google Brain team. We’d love to answer your questions (again)
We had so much fun at our 2016 AMA that we’re back again! We are a group of research scientists and engineers that work on the Google Brain team. You can learn more about us and our work at g.co/brain, including a list of our publications, our blog posts, our team's mission and culture, some of our particular areas of research, and can read about the experiences of our first cohort of Google Brain Residents who “graduated” in June of 2017. You can also learn more about the TensorFlow system that our group open-sourced at tensorflow.org in November, 2015. In less than two years since its open-source release, TensorFlow has attracted a vibrant community of developers, machine learning researchers and practitioners from all across the globe. We’re excited to talk to you about our work, including topics like creating machines that learn how to learn, enabling people to explore deep learning right in their browsers, Google's custom machine learning TPU chips and systems (TPUv1 and TPUv2), use of machine learning for robotics and healthcare, our papers accepted to ICLR 2017, ICML 2017 and NIPS 2017 (public list to be posted soon), and anything else you all want to discuss. We're posting this a few days early to collect your questions here, and we’ll be online for much of the day on September 13, 2017, starting at around 9 AM PDT to answer your questions. Edit: 9:05 AM PDT: A number of us have gathered across many locations including Mountain View, Montreal, Toronto, Cambridge (MA), and San Francisco. Let's get this going! Edit 2: 1:49 PM PDT: We've mostly finished our large group question answering session. Thanks for the great questions, everyone! A few of us might continue to answer a few more questions throughout the day.
