[PTR] Peyton Manning on Tim Duncanâ€™s advice about staying in school: "I talked to Tim. He stayed for his senior year which was against the norm. He said, 'Hey, I wanted to be a senior, I wanted one more year to get ready.' It let me know that it was OK to stay & it's the best decision I ever made."
