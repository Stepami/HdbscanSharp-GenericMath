/u/Poyo-Poyo on TIL Adolf Hitler was the first European leader to ban human zoos, a popular attraction in Europe where exotic peoples were paid to be on exhibit for onlookers, with recreated habitats and shows. Belgium was the last to ban them, in 1958.
The major question is: was the black man IN on it? I mean, was he there voluntarily, knowing what was going on, for whatever the zoo payed him to be there? or was he like someone who had never seen civilized society?
