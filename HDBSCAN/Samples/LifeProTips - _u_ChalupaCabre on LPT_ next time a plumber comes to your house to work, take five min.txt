/u/ChalupaCabre on LPT: next time a plumber comes to your house to work, take five minutes to clean the room they're working in.
Electrician here.. can concur, almost nobody cleans up first. That said, the state some people live in is absolute top notch cleanliness, while the spectrum ranges to long time hoarder and the majority of the population living in typical over worked, under-motivated to clean, untidy and slightly filthy homes.
