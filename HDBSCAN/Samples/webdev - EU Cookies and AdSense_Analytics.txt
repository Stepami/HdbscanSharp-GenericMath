EU Cookies and AdSense/Analytics
After 5 years of not running ads or Google Analytics on my sites I'm wanting to start again. I see they have made things even more confusing. Let us assume, for the purpose of this post: Either/both Google AdSense and Analytics policy require me to comply with EU cookie policy I actually want to comply My sites don't use cookies of their own for any purpose; only the Google snippets use them I am able to incorporate e.g. Cookie Consent on my pages  What am I supposed to do if the EU user opts out of cookies? (Or fails to opt in for countries with that law.) I don't see instructions from Google on how to tell their snippets, "hey, this user opted out of cookies." Am I supposed to prevent their code from running if there is no cookie consent, in effect having no ads or analytics at all? Or is there a way to pass the "psst, no cookies" on to Google so they can provide a non-tracking ad/stats experience? I mean, really, it's not my site tracking anyone, it's Google's servers. But Google's language is very vague and unhelpful. For a multi-choice answer, and assuming I have Cookie Consent or similar library working: My site needs to do nothing because they are CDN-fronted static sites with no domain cookies My site needs to notify the Google AdSense and/or Analytics code of the consent status with a function call, event trigger, etc. (please specify) My site needs to prevent the AdSense and Analytics code from executing in the first place if consent is required but not provided (if so, why doesn't Google provide examples of this?)  (Snarky rhetorical question: how do you save negative consent for future visits if you can't use a cookie to do it?)  submitted by /u/midnightFreddie [link] [comments]
