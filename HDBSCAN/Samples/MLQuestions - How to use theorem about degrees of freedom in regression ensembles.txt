How to use theorem about degrees of freedom in regression ensembles
I was going over this paper on regression ensembles. One of the results of the paper is a way to optimise the diversity parameter. To achieve this one needs to apply the Theorem 3 outlined in the paper. I'm having trouble doing this. I see that we need the results from Theorem 2, but I don't really understand what is the trace (in Theorem 3) I need to compute to get the degrees of freedom of the ensemble estimator. Any thoughts? I guess this is a notation shortcoming on my part, and would appreciate some help going over this. By the way, this is a great paper which won the Best Student Paper Award in ESANN 2017  submitted by /u/jonas_skopje [link] [comments]
