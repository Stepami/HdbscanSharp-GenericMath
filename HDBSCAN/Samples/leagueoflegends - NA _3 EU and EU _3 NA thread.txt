NA <3 EU and EU <3 NA thread
Don't think this will get much traction, but amongst all the trash talk throughout the year and the multitude of weekly trashtalk threads, there comes a time where Reddit needs to band together and root for the west as a whole. So I'm suggesting in this thread everyone say something nice and hype up western league of legends, I'm from NA so I'll start: I think Misfits is being sorely underrated, if they play their best game they can easily make it out of Group D, possibly even as the 1 seed.
