/u/Frogmire1 on Russell Westbrook's contract extension will have ripple effect on Thunder, other NBA stars
You’re acting like this guy will be playing like 40 at 32. Westbrook seems like an athletic freak like LeBron, both are so athletic they’ll be able to play longer. Westbrook’s three has improved significantly where he is near league average. Westbrook fully recovered and then some from the knee injuries and I have no doubt he’s gonna play for at a high level for another 5 years.
