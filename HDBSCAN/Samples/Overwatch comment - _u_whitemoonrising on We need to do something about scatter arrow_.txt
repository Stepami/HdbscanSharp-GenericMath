And you do realize he is a sniper, right? Come on, man. If you're gonna complain about the strength of one character's particular ability then I should be able to complain about stuff like "Soldier's helix rockets do so much splash damage". Everyone has that one ability or trait that's annoying as hell. I accepted that not too long ago, and since doing that I've been able to enjoy myself more. There are so many posts and comments here pitching ideas of changing characters, and some of them are completely absurd. Honestly, basically all of the characters are fine. They all are OP in their own unique way. Making threads on an hourly basis to try and change every single character because a player had a hard time against them in a particular game is silly. Not accusing you of doing that, rather talking about the community as a whole
