/u/tyler5673 on Is it the norm for everyone to constantly try to show how smart they are in this field?
Its a side effect of imposter syndrome. This is extremely prevalent in fields that are so large that no single person can possibly know everything there is to know about all aspects of the field. The best approach to handling it is being aware of it, actively listening when others interrupt, and providing your input and feedback once the chatter has settled down.
