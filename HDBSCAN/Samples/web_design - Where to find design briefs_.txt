Where to find design briefs?
Hey, would anyone be able to help me find mock (or even real) design briefs. I'm wanting to practice my design skills, wire-framing etc and then go on to creating a final website to start off somewhat of a portfolio. Any help would be really appreciated! Thanks!  submitted by /u/Freeptom [link] [comments]
