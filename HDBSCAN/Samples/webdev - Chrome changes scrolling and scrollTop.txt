Chrome changes scrolling and scrollTop
I am doing a lot of testing right now, but if you have any code that used $("body").scrollTop() you might have noticed over the last week that it was broken with the new chrome update. It appears that chrome no longer acknowledges scrollTop on body. I have been hastily changing scrollspies and paralax code to activate on either the document or the html element. It appears selecting the value of $(document).scrollTop() is working, but $(document).animate({scrollTop}) won't work, and instead should animate on $("html")  submitted by /u/bronkula [link] [comments]
