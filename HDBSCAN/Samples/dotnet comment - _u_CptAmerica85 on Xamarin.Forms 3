/u/CptAmerica85 on Xamarin.Forms 3 - What's New
You don't have to recompile your code at all on react native. If you have hot reloading enabled it updates instantly. If not, you save the file then refresh your emulator view and you can see your changes. I'm working on a xamarin project for work, and also some react native stuff at home for personal stuff. React native is so far ahead of xamarin it's not even funny.
