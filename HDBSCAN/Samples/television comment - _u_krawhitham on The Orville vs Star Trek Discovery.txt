/u/krawhitham on The Orville vs Star Trek Discovery
The Orville by a mile, Discovery is an ok Science Fiction show but a horrible Star Trek show. The Orville is fun Science Fiction like TNG before it. Discovery is not fun in any way, it is war Science Fiction. The Orville is out Star Treking Star Trek
