Best resource for a "speed review" of DS&A
Current senior undergrad. Haven't taken DS&A since Spring 2016. Am really rusty. For example, I don't remember how to delete an element from a BST (I do remember there are different cases to consider, and that it's trickier than the other ops). Going to try to go with Java, possibly Python, as language of choice. Need to get up to speed, fast, before "grinding leetcode." I am considering: ---CTCI ---Coursera: Sedgwick's Princeton Algorithms course ---Coursera: Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization (UCSD) EDIT: Ceteris Paribus, I learn better in the MOOC-style as opposed to reading books.  submitted by /u/oshkosh_b [link] [comments]
