The Cactopus Appreciation Thread
I know the whole Reddit league community fucking loves this guoy. His comments always bring some humor, they deliver pertinent information and he gets it done quickly and properly. Riot has done an amazing job, and they got lucky that this guy wants to and enjoys working for your company. But Cactopus, keep being fuckin awesome dude, keep on being hilarious, and keep on delivering the best league related information. Edit: Whoever gilded me for this low quality, low effort post should be ashamed ;)  submitted by /u/Mokman7 [link] [comments]
