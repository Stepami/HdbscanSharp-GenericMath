TIFU by pointing a water pistol at my year 7 teacher
As per usual story did not happen today! When I was 12 years old (9 years ago) I Was sat in English class and one of my friends bought in a plastic water pistol we were all sat on a table playing around with it pretending to shoot each other, I thought it would be a good idea to stand up and pretend to shoot the teacher with the gun... this is where I fucked up The teacher then runs out of the classroom and tells everyone to get out and leave me in there, so I’m sat in here all alone confused as fuck about what’s gone on fuck it I think and just sit there playing on my phone with the gun sat in front of me, about 20 minutes later the door gets busted open and my 12 year old self absolutely shits himself a few armed policemen storm in and point guns directly at me whilst the whole block I was on has been evacuated “WHERES THE GUN PUT IT DOWN AND WALK AWAY” so I put the gun down back off and try to not slosh the shit around in my underwear. Baring in mind this is in England where guns are incredibly hard to get hold of I get handcuffed and put in the back of a police van with an armed guard sat in the back with me again I reiterate I was so confused to why I was being arrested, I got completely searched made sure I had nothing on me they interviewed me and the main question was “why did you have a real gun on you” it was a dark blue gun with a orange tip??? How on earth did they not tell it was fake after explaining all this they finally let me go and I got no further action. As for school I was removed from my first year of school for 6 months and was accepted back in for the second year, fucking shit confused the hell outta me... TL;DR pointed water pistol at teacher armed police pointed their water pistols back  submitted by /u/PM_ME_PSN_CODES_THX [link] [comments]
