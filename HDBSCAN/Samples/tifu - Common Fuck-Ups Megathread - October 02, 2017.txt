Common Fuck-Ups Megathread - October 02, 2017
Welcome to the common fuck-ups megathread. You suggested it, and we listened.  You may be wondering what a "common fuck-up" is. Normally they are topics that are non-noteworthy or unoriginal, the minor things we fuck up. You can view them in our [wiki]. While we are being lax on this rule within this thread, we want to remind everyone that every other rule still applies, which can be found on our sidebar or [wiki/rules] page. We will be having 2 megathreads a week: Monday-Friday for normal common fuck-ups Friday-Sunday for nfsw (rule 4) common fuck-ups  wiki pages: / detailed rules page / sidebar link / list of common fuck-ups / flair/NFSW filters / rules(report reasons) / FUOTW archive / other subs /  submitted by /u/AutoModerator [link] [comments]
