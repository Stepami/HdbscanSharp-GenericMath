[MAIN SPOILERS] About breaking the wheel...
So when the Greyjoys meet with the queen and ask that they be their own kingdom, Dany is all on board and even says "theyre not demanding, theyre asking... the other kingdoms can ask too" or something. Jump to Jon Snow showing up, she absolutely isn't having any of that noise and threatens his ass with treason.... would she really have reacted much different if he ASKED to be a seperate kingdom? Or did she just need the fleet from the greyjoys and didnt need shit from the north...  submitted by /u/Illiterate_BookClub [link] [comments]
