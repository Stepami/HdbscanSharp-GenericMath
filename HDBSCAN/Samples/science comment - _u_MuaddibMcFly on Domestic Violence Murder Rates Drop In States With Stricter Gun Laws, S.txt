/u/MuaddibMcFly on Domestic Violence Murder Rates Drop In States With Stricter Gun Laws, Study Finds
Why are all the finding of Australia introducing gun control being ignored in the US?  Because there are way too many confounds. Case in point: In 1991, the Australian homicide rate was 1.9/100k. In 1996 they enacted some pretty strict firearms legislation. By 2007, their homicide rate had dropped to 1.3/100k, for a 32% drop. Source Over the same timeframe, the States made it much easier to get concealed carry permits and the US homicide rate went from 9.8/100k to 5.9/100k, a 40% drop. At best, that means that strengthening firearms legislation has no discriminating impact on homicide rates. How do you reconcile two nations taking different, antithetical approaches to firearms, yet achieving similar results? How do you account for the fact that the 50 year low in US homicide rate is more than double the Australian multi-decade high homicide rate?
