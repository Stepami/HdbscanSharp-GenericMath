Again, I'd change fields of work. I've done the retail gig and didn't like it. Retail has suck a large employment base for relatively quick to learn tasks. Not insulting anyone who works in retail on the floor level. Since it's a lot of small tasks and a large work force, it does indeed become hard to compete. I've never denied that, it takes someone flat out determined to make retail their profession to stand a chance. As for management, you gotta see the other side of the coin. They deal with tons of employees that cycle though and drop out. They deal with tons of various issues and any human being would start to setup walls or not tolerate certain behaviors. Also lower management cannot change policy at the drop of a hat, since most retail that has a corporate office has to submit changes to an already large and complex system, then await response, and/or action. I've been on the lowest of lows, worked hard, not pay off, then move on. It's that nature of the beast in ALL fields of work. Sometimes it's not the employee but the company. My father works retail and after a long time, it paid off decently for him, but retail came naturally for him. He started as a stocker, and now is a regional manager. He didn't brown nose, but went above and beyond (not all at one company by the way) and eventually it worked for him. Not going to be everyone's story but it worked for him.
