Where can I get help with a small design project for my WordPress site?
I want something basic. I'm looking to create a new 'Like' button for my site. However, the design services I find online are all about building a website from scratch. And they expect me to pay thousands for their service. Does anyone know of a simple web designer that can make a rather simple addition to my blog? Maybe I should just take the matter into my own hands and learn how to design it myself?  submitted by /u/AppKnow [link] [comments]
