Trasfering my Computer as safe as possible through Bus
So I go to study away from my house and I'll take a bus to go to the place I'll stay while studying, I would like to take my computer with me plus the suitcase with the clothes and all the necessity that I will need as long as I am in the new place. My question is how can I transfer with all of this in the best way and as inappropriate as possible?(pc,monitor,clothes are my concern) Thanks for reading and all the replies in advance :)  submitted by /u/Ereomiru [link] [comments]
