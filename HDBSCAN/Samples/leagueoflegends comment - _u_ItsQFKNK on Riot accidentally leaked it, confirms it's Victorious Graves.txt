/u/ItsQFKNK on Riot accidentally leaked it, confirms it's Victorious Graves
I reckon the Victorious skins are based more heavily on the Spring meta than the Summer meta. They gotta have plenty of time to make the skin and assets and shit. It's not like Graves wasn't a thing this season in competitive anyway. He was the second most picked/banned jungler during Spring.
