/u/dandavis111 on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’
It doesn't matter who said what. Trump manages to make himself look like a sociopathic baby with absolutely zero ability to feel any amount of empathy for anything. Why would you compare death tolls? People have lost loved ones and he's saying they should be proud? Your president is a buffoon and your country appears to be going down the toilet. Enjoy that.
