Free Stuff for Students??? It's not easy to find!
Is it true that being an Information Technology student lets you get free software from Microsoft? In particular Windows 10 and Visual Studio? I am on their "store" site and even though I signed up with an .edu address they are saying that I can not be verified. It's a bit irritating.  submitted by /u/fatandhilarious [link] [comments]
