/u/DKahnt on TIFU with airport security
I went flying alone the summer after 9/11. I was 21 at the time. I tend to crack jokes when I'm nervous. I get nervous when flying. My mom had to look into my eyes and tell me, "Do not say bomb." I said, "Don't worry mom." She continued, "I know you.... don't say bomb." While waiting in line for security I had to bite my tongue many times because I was so nervous about saying the wrong thing.
