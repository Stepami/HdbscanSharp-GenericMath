/u/ChangingChance on [Garcia] Manu on his legacy: "I want to be remembered as a good person, a good dude, that I was around in town, fun to watch. But after a few years it'll be forgotten. The legacy thing is very overrated. If you live your life thinking about legacy or what you'll leave, then you add another concern."
Legacy... What is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.
