Monster Encounter Generator (Help!)
I've set up a database with a set of monsters, each with an xp value. There is a parameter for overall xp budget for a fight I need the query to bring back a random subset of rows whos xp sum is = the xp budget. I realize this is a tough problem. I struggled with it for a few hours tonight. The challenge is you can't just crossjoin the monster table to itself once because it could be 5 or 6 monsters that is picked, or just 1 monster. It could also be 4 of the same monster if each was worth 25% of the budget. I think this is possible because I saw a tool for this working for a different gaming system, but I want to make my own for the gaming system I play. Can anyone help me with an algorithm? The important fields are pretty much just Name(Monster Name) and XP(The exp it is worth). Later I will adjust the query to look at other things like Monster Type, Subtype, monster variety, max xp per monster, etc.  submitted by /u/Gigglestomp123 [link] [comments]
