[Mod Raven] Our rewatch will begin this Sunday. (Full details inside.)
TL;DR Our annual rewatch begins on Sunday and we'll go at a rate of one episode each week. It'll be formatted similarly to last year's. Introduction Every off-season the sub has tried to do a rewatch, but the last couple of years there hasn't been much interest. The impending conclusion of the show can be felt a little more acutely now though, so this rewatch will run as long as possible. We made an announcement on Sunday and here are a few more details. On The Rewatches Each week, we will put up a thread with the [Everything] spoiler scope on Sunday, which will act similarly to our usual on-season Post-Episode Discussion threads. The rewatch threads will contain links to our official threads as well as the top threads from that week; popular fan-created series post series, such as Alt Shift X's episode analyses (for seasons six and seven) and ChrysWatchesGot's recaps; and the original post-episode surveys. We will also have mini post-episode surveys so you can see what you all think of the episodes in hindsight. We may also do some contests during the rewatch as well. Schedule Here is a schedule (may be subject to change) for our rewatch that includes most of the major episodes. Keep in mind that we will be rewatching all of the episodes in order. These ones are listed out because they are some of the more important ones.

However, at the very least, we will have completed seasons one through four. Conclusion Everyone is looking forward to rewatching the series from the beginning once more with all of you. See you on Sunday. Pets will be very welcome in the rewatch threads  submitted by /u/DatNerdOverThere [link] [comments]
