Using AI to help AI learn - A new feature to drastically decrease chatbot training time
Whatever your industry, data is now the heart of the battle. From the very beginning of our bot building platform, we understood that to allow the creation of great bots, they would need huge and qualified datasets. We tried kindly asking the GAFAs, but they're not in a sharing mood. Today, collaboration made our platform reach an incredible level of precision and is now able to change the way we build bots. Announcing Expressions Suggestions: faster intent training Let’s get back to basics: when building a bot, you first create intents. Intents can be seen as boxes in your bot’s brain, defining the different topics it can understand (greetings, weather, food, drinks, etc). You need to enter a certain amount of sentences in each intent to train your bot. It’s a tedious process; you have to think of sentences meaning the same thing that are all different. You have to picture all the different ways a question can be asked. You sometimes have to use slang, sometimes formal speech. And you have to do that in different languages! Step back, have a coffee: now, Recast.AI can do that for you. When entering one sentence, our AI suggests others that might match. And the more you use this feature, the sharper it’ll be. This is a truly innovative way to think about bot building; what better than AI to train AI? Because of the importance of intent training, we decided to avoid relying on full-automation. Thanks to our latest feature, your bots will be both more precise and faster to create. ![ExpSuggestions.GIF](https://i.imgur.com/9BoFmlK.gif) Want to try it out? Go on Recast.AI, create a bot, an intent, and see the magic. What is Recast.AI? Recast.AI started as a NLP API two years ago to evolve in a fully-fledged bot building platform. Our ambition is to offer services addressing every bot builder needs. * Bot Builder: Using a visual builder, you can set up your bot conversation flow. * Bot Hosting: Using git, our hosting service eases the deploy and maintenance process for your bots. * Bot Connector:The connector (available for any bots, even if not made on Recast.AI) allows you to deploy on several platform from one place. It standardizes the messaging format accross platform, making it much easier to deploy and maintain a bot over several channels. * Bot Analytics: a unique place to check all your bots metrics and logs to help you refine its flow until it's perfect. The learning is shared across the entire platform: usage and training of any bot made on Recast.AI improves the platform as a whole. Collaboration doesn't stop there: users can fork bots and intents from each others, so they don't have to reinvent the wheel. Moreover, we maintain a scaffolder bot with the most recurrent intents users can fork to speed up their bot development process: greetings, ask a joke, ask weather, booking... You can also keep your bot private if you wish. We're French, but we wanted to share the love with the whole planet: the plaftorm is language agnostic - you can build a bot talking any language there is! En voiture Simone!
