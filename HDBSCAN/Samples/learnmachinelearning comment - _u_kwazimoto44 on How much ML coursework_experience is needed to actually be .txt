/u/kwazimoto44 on How much ML coursework/experience is needed to actually be able to work in the industry?
This is great, thank you. If very much depends on who you want to work for in the industry. There's a big difference between Google Brain and some tiny startup.  I guess the main thing to identify is if you'd want to make ML your full-time-all-encompassing role vs. working on a specific, more narrow application geared towards a startup, thus possibly getting rid of the need for a PhD
