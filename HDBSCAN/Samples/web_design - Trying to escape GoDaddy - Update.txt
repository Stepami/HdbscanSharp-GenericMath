Trying to escape GoDaddy - Update
So I checked a few places, but there are a series of problems. When GoDaddy acquired BlueRazor, I was on a plan where I pay only 6.25 a month (MONTH TO MONTH). No yearly tethering or contract nonsense. I can get an SSL cert (only one, but that will serve for now) for about $70 a year. I checked a few places and they all seem to have minimum of a yearly payment and the total amounts are 12 or more dollars a month. They even charge more for domains per year than GoDaddy. Am I totally missing something here? GoDaddy CAN'T be the best option can it? I mean, with their horrible reputation, I'd love to switch, but A2 Hosting was really hard to reach (which was disappointing) and Bluehost charges almost double what I'd get staying with GoDaddy. The few others I looked at had cheap intro rates, but then they went up after that (assuming those rates even counted what I need and do I really want to switch services every few years?) What am I missing folks? As a reminder: I have unlimited hosting, MySQL databases, PHP, about 6 domain names, a need for one SSL for now (possibly one or two others later). I do use Wordpres, but I manage all my files and domains myself. I use FTP and upload my wordpress installation, manually set up my databases with PHPmyAdmin, and in the case of at least one of my sites, code directly in PHP/MySQL (no Wordpress). It doesn't seem like my needs are that extreme.  submitted by /u/suddenly_ponies [link] [comments]
