SOA's a chore too. 1 and 2 were peak. But then it goes on, and it's like by some convoluted method Jax will figure a way out of the season's problem/villain - will kill them and set someone else up for the blame. At no point do the other gangs start to realize, "hey maybe this Sons of Anarchy gang, the only common thread in all these deals going awry. The only gang who comes out clean in the end - hey maybe they're behind all the shit going down and we shouldn't trust them." Like it's pretty simple. Every deal with the SOA goes to shit. But each time it's Jax blaming it on somebody else. But the writers never thought any of their rivals would figure it out. Plus it starts going more for "shock factor" over say an actual epic moment or a touching moment, or a character dying in a way that reaches out to the audience. Then there's musical montages. Enough SOA.
