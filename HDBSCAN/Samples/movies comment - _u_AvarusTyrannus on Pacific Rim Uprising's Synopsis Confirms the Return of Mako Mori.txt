/u/AvarusTyrannus on Pacific Rim Uprising's Synopsis Confirms the Return of Mako Mori
Very true, my complaint with Star Wars is that they dragged it on too far with some of the later books and such. Anakin turning out to be Force Jesus and the like. I did enjoy how Rouge One was able to just drop you into the universe that had already been established and run with it, might be why I liked it so much when I'm not a fan of the other movies so much. Â  Inception I think also pulls this off really well, a very complicated concept but the movie very carefully fills you in on what you need to know exactly when you need to know it. I don't need every aspect of the dream machine blasted at me in act one because some of it won't matter until 60min through the movie.
