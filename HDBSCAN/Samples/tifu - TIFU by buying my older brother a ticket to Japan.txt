TIFU by buying my older brother a ticket to Japan
So my older brother was turning 21 two years ago, and I thought it'd be a really nice surprise to buy him a ticket to Japan as a present as we hadn't really gone overseas or had an amazing trip to anywhere in the world so I thought it'd be such an amazing experience for him and so I went to our local Flight Centre to book the flight. I purchase it for him to leave around December for around two weeks, it costed around $1,100 and I decided to buy travel insurance just in case for another ~$100. It did cost quite a bit however it was something I wanted to do because it was something we never got to experience before. My family was telling me no, it was to expensive and I shouldn't have bought it but I let them know it was okay, his flight is in a few months he'll be able to save up for it by then. Fast forward to today, I just got a call from the Flight Centre saying that he hadn't showed up for his flight and that it may now be Non Refundable. As well as that, I had to rebook his flight for the following year last year as he wouldn't be able to make it, which was fine but it did cost another 400. So all in all, I FU by trying to do something special for my older brother but ended up possibly $1,600 out of pocket. Tl;Dr Wanted to do something special for older brother by purchasing a plane ticket to Japan, only to have it changed and no showed and leaving a hole out of my pocket. I still love him though. Just wish he would've atleast cancelled or something so atleast we could've gotten something back. Thanks for reading Going to go cry in a corner now Edit: Sorry my maths, 1.2 + 4 = 1.6 not 1.4.
