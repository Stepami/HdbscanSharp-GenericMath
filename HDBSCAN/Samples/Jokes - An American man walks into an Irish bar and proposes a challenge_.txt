An American man walks into an Irish bar and proposes a challenge.
An American man walks into an Irish bar and proposes a challenge. "I hear you Irish men are great for the drink, but I want some proof" and proceeds to put $200 on the bar. "If any of ye can drink 10 drinks in 10 minutes, you can get this $200. I'll buy the drinks." All Irish men go silent, and one murmurs to himself and leave. 15 minutes later the Irish man comes back and goes up to the American and accepts his challenge. Sure enough, the Irish man drank all 10 drinks in a whopping 8 minutes. "Impressive" the American man says "but may I ask where you went before you took the challenge?" "Went to the pub next door to see if I could do it first"  submitted by /u/Cormoe123 [link] [comments]
