/u/shakhaki on Is Alibaba Cloud a series competitor in the cloud computing space?
I do follow the cloud space quite well. I work for Microsoft and deal a lot with Azure for our commercial customers. I agree that the big 3 are Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, but I won't underestimate the impact these niche players can have. Google and Microsoft have something Amazon doesn't, that most observers would say would be their doom; if they weren't first to market. AWS is strictly a service whereas Google and Microsoft have enterprise software that they offer; and in the case of Microsoft discount or allow use of their licenses without extra charge just for using the cloud.
