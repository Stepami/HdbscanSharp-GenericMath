How to become a researcher in the field of computer vision?
Hi reddit folks! I'm an international student who wants to get admission for masters in CS at UIUC. But as I've learned, it's not so easy to get in for an average student like me. I have a B.S. In information technology and I wanna do research in AI and HCI, but the thing is I have zero experience in research or work. But I really want to be a professional in AI and do research in computer vision and object recognition to be specific. Do you guys have any suggestions that what I can do to get into a top university like that without any related background? I know I should have research experience and stuff but well, I don't! Do you think admission officers would give me a chance? I wanna know more about people who are in this area, what they struggle with, and what they'd suggest to enthusiastic people who are new to the field and would like to become an expert in AI and computer vision? What skills should I gain?  submitted by /u/Fireyf0untain [link] [comments]
