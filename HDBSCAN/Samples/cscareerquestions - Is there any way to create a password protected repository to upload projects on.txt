Is there any way to create a password protected repository to upload projects onto for interviewers to see?
Basically I want to upload all my projects onto a repository, similar to GitHub but make it private to the public. Except if you access it with a link and enter the password, you can view all the files. I have a GitHub private repo with all my files but it doesn't have any option like that, are there any other sites? I have a lot of school projects on mine and don't want anything to be fully public because it could be plagiarized. Thanks!  submitted by /u/Bartleby_The [link] [comments]
