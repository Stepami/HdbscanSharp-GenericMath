/u/CountFlandy on I am Interested in making comics about Life with Asperger's Syndrome and I'd like some advice.
For a while I worked on a web comic based off a bunch of characters I made up over the years, the main character was only written by me, and because my co-writer refused to write his dialogue ("Couldn't do the character justice") he became almost like my clone, and so I then used that knowledge to write things based on my perspective and to use that to make him and me the same, thus giving my character all of my quirks (The most impactful issue being the one I made most obvious.) So, to be honest, I found it best to use your own experiences, but skew then In one direction. Comedy? Exaggerate a little but don't over do it. Serious? Be real and down to earth, but maybe change a few major parts to keep your personal life separate from it. There's a lot of potential here. If you have any questions about any of the whole thing you can pm me about them, However do keep in mind I wrote it, and have no artistic skill.
