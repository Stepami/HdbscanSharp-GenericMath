/u/Drachte on 30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty
open carry=/= in your hands lol in fact thats considered brandishing and if someone else shoots you because you walk into a store with a rifle in your hand, they'd probably be in a better position Open carry just means you don't have to have it hidden, doesn't mean you can walk around toting it. There are rules as to how you must carry it but it varies state by state
