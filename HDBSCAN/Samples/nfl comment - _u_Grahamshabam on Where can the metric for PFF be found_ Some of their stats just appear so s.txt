/u/Grahamshabam on Where can the metric for PFF be found? Some of their stats just appear so slanted and biased.
Patently false. They have graders who assign a value to every play the player plays, I believe between -2 (catastrophically bad) and 2 (otherwordly highlight) and then compile them for game grades. They explain it on their website
