Chris Paul has not attempted a mid-ranger through the first two games of the preseason
He's only attempted one 2-point shot which was a fast break lay-up. One of the reasons the Rockets lost to the Spurs in last year's playoffs was that the predictability of their offense (only 3s and shots near the basket) allowed the Spurs to have their immobile bigs like Pau Gasol hang back at the basket in the P&R which the Rockets couldn't take advantage of because they never shot mid-rangers. Given that Chris Paul is one of the all-time great mid range shooters, one might've thought the Rockets would adjust their system a bit to give CP3 a few mid-range shots and add some more variety to their offense. From the early preseason play though, it seems like the Rockets are sticking to the same strategy of avoiding mid-rangers like the plague and CP3 will have to adjust his game to fit within the Rockets system, rather than the other way around.  submitted by /u/widesheep [link] [comments]
