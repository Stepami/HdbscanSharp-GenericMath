/u/jbrownz2006 on TIL in Finland, some children read to dogs and cows because they actually like listening and are extremely attentive.
Check with your local shelters, humane societies, or adoption centers. I have a humane society 10 minutes from my house and I can read to dogs. It's a great volunteer opportunity, and helps the dogs with their social skills needed for adoption. It's great for kids too: kids get to learn to read, dog gets to be happy dog.
