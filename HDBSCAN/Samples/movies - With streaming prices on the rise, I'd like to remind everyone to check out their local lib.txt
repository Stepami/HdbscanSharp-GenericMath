With streaming prices on the rise, I'd like to remind everyone to check out their local library!
Hey, everyone! I've been reading a lot of the discussions about streaming services and their pricing. I'll admit, I use about 4 different streaming sites but I've been hoping to narrow it down. About a month ago, I decided to finally visit my local library. I was AMAZED at how many movies were available to check out. They allow 5 at a time and you can hold as many as you like on the hold shelf for up to a week. The online catalogue is very easy to navigate and you can even request movies from other branches to be delivered. You can narrow down the search to just DVD and can organize by release date and even search specific genres. I have a "queue" of about 50 movies right now and I've been stopping in every few days to swap out the ones I've watched with the ones on hold. I usually check out 5, hold 5 and repeat going down my list. Also, if somebody else has it checked out, it puts you on a waiting list and alerts you when it's back! At first I thought that it would be more of a hassle than hunting a movie down on various sites but I am pleasantly surprised that the whole process is easy and efficient. Anyways, that's my two cents on library movie rentals! I hope you all have as much luck as I did. Enjoy!  submitted by /u/low_power_mode [link] [comments]
