Alcohol actually is a 4th type.of calorie that our body cannot process, it's not carbs. The fact that our bodies cannot process it like we do other calories is precisely what makes it dangerous/toxic because the liver has to do the work and yuelds no energy for the body. I don't drink, and have lost all desire to really. Just not worth it imo especially on gear
