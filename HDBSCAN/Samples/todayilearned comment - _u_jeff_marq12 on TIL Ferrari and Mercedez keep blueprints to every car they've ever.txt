/u/jeff_marq12 on TIL Ferrari and Mercedez keep blueprints to every car they've ever made and will produce parts for them if you need one repaired.
Late to the party, but these mid engine supercar’s and hypercar’s are purposely designed to break in half in a serious enough crash. The cockpit’s stay rigid and are incredibly safe for what they are, but having something that can burst into flames right behind your head is a huge liability.
