Hey I need help with lists.
I'm making this "bar project" for practice. It's a console application and basically what happens is that you come in to a "bar", get asked your age and order a drink from a list of drinks. I've created two classes. The first one called Drinks.cs looks like this:   public class Drinks { private string _name; private double _price; public string Name { set; get; } public double Price { set; get; } }  Inside of Bar.cs I have a method to list the drinks:   public void listAlcohol() { Drinks[] listDrinks = new Drinks[3]; listDrinks[0].Name = "Whiskey"; listDrinks[0].Price = 25; listDrinks[1].Name = "Beer"; listDrinks[1].Price = 12; listDrinks[2].Name = "Vodka"; listDrinks[2].Price = 16; List alcoholList = new List(); alcoholList.Add(listDrinks[0]); alcoholList.Add(listDrinks[1]); alcoholList.Add(listDrinks[2]); Console.WriteLine(alcoholList[0]); Console.WriteLine(alcoholList[1]); Console.WriteLine(alcoholList[2]); }    I'm getting an error at this line:  listDrinks[0].Name = "Whiskey";  System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.' Can you help me fix this?  submitted by /u/nTesla27 [link] [comments]
