/u/A_st_J on After California got rid of the personal belief exemption for vaccinations, medical exemptions for vaccinations went up, suggesting that the Senate bill isnâ€™t as strong as hoped, since anti-vaxxers were still able to find doctors willing to provide a medical exemption instead, as reported in JAMA.
"Formaldehyde has a long history of safe use in the manufacture of certain viral and bacterial vaccines... The amount of formaldehyde present in some vaccines is so small compared to the concentration that occurs naturally in the body that it does not pose a safety concern...Studies have shown that for a newborn of average weight of 6 - 8 pounds, the amount of formaldehyde in their body is 50-70 times higher than the upper amount that they could receive from a single dose of a vaccine or from vaccines administered over time." Feel free to link to a peer reviewed study that shows detrimental effects on formaldehyde in vaccines. I'd love to see it. Otherwise your claims are baseless.
