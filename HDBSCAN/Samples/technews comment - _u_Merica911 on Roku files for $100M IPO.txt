/u/Merica911 on Roku files for $100M IPO
And other part of my point is that the TV (actually TV) is in Jeopardy. The new born generation don't watch TV, they watch the ipad or tablet. Why sit on a couch, 7 feet away, watch something mandatory for what ever network channel you're on when an ipad 1 inch away from you face watching world star fight videos off of YouTube while playing Mine craft (good luck with their attention span) But that's another dimension of roku problem, it's only for a TV OS where every big box electronic store will tell you TV sells are less and less every year. The roku will be like how the vcr was (or still is for some people lol), everyone will have 1 but rarely ever use it.. Normally we would say that will happen 5 to 10 years from now but since technology is in hyper drive right now it could be 2 to 3 years where roku sales are cut to 50 % less than previous years. I love the roku but in 2017 it's all about the ecosystem. Technologist are already designing either all Android houses or Apple houses, where all appliances ( Internet of Things) runs off a certain platform and you're talking to it.. And again, roku would not be in these designs because of it's OS
