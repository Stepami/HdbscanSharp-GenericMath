/u/Talked10101 on How do American programmers compete with Eastern European guys?
You will find that the majority of the better Eastern European devs are not working for freelance/outsourcing companies. In Moscow, for instance the majority of the real top performers are working for companies such as Avito, Mail.ru, Yandex or other companies that pay quite well compared with the cost of living in Russia. There are also lots of other software companies which you wouldn't realise are based in Eastern Europe, who can compensate there employees well comparatively by selling software into Western markets. This leaves a lot of the leftover talent looking to freelance online, being lower quality reflected in both salary and willingness to take on any job thrown their way.
