/u/pliskin42 on It's been a long 4 years of development, but my Road Rash tribute game finally launches today
I honestly don't know OP well enough to estimate how his little start up is with this kinda stuff. But literally that point can be argued for just about any game company. Just because the money is used to pay people/as capitol to do more projects doesn't excuse over charging on product. Especially when those products are the types of things that arguably should exist in the base game. Think about it like this. Imagine you go to a restaurant, and see that they sell fresh brewed tea. You order some, and they bring you out a pot, but nothing to sweeten it with. When you ask they let you know that sugar or honey would be an extra dollar. Wouldn't you be at least kinda pissed? Would your annoyance be abated by the staff telling you that they use the money to make more tea or other nice meals for you to purchase?
