Pre-ordered the new xbox but it says it won't be available until 11/30. Why?
As the title says I pre-ordered the Xbox One X which has a release date of 11/7. However when I look at my orders page in the Microsoft Store is says that it won't be available until 11/30. Does anyone know why it is so late?  submitted by /u/CREAMPIESURPRISE [link] [comments]
