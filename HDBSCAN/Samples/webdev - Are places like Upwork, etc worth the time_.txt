Are places like Upwork, etc worth the time?
I'm in need of money right now and the job search isn't going well at all. Are places like Upwork, Elance easy to get work at or would I be better just posting flyers around my town for one day websites for $100? Anyone have any suggestions on getting some work or am I just screwed.  submitted by /u/rbeason [link] [comments]
