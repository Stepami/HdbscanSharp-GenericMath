/u/RNGod2512 on I keep getting this weird error and cannot find a fix for it at all. "Your rendering device has been lost!"
The problem is with the recent AMD drivers, roll them back one version for now. I've had the exact same issue and it was even suggested in a blue post somewhere to do so. This is specific to AMD only.
