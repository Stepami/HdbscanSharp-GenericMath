Replace numbers with alpha alias?
This is my first run at nlp. Is there an existing function in any language, preferably python or vba, that automatically replaces numbers with aliases? I could code something and I certainly may - my concern is simply whether I am missing any unique number contexts which I have not yet encountered. An existing function would help with that part. Below are some of my search terms and desired replacements. I had initially started finding/replacing my hand in excel but quickly realized how many possibilities there are. Something automatic would be nice. Any ideas? by (number), you will have… where number is age and is followed by event. 911 (number) years (number) months (number) weeks (number) days 100% xx% tip... where xx% is a tip amount in 2017 by (number) where number is a time of day xx% where the percent is anything other than 100%, as 100% typically has a distinct meaning and context. $xx where x is some dollar amount and may be more or less than 2 digits and contains commas and decimals in (number) where number is year other than 2017 (number) years old I have selected the corresponding replacement values for each instance in text: ‘myage’ (myage) ‘nnn’ (nine one one) ‘sy’ (some years) ‘sm’ (some months) ‘sw’ (some weeks) ‘sd’ (some days) ‘hpct’ (hundred percent) ‘tpmt’ (tip amount) ‘crtyr’ (current year) ‘st’ (some time) ‘smp’ (some percent) ‘sdd’ (some dollar) ‘smcy’ (some calendar year) ‘sy’ some years  submitted by /u/joshman108 [link] [comments]
