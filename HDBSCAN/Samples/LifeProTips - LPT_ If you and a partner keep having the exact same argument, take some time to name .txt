LPT: If you and a partner keep having the exact same argument, take some time to name the argument. When it comes up again, call it out by name and start the conversation where it usually ends.
With your partner, define what the argument is - when it comes up, what it encompasses, the resolution (if any), etc. Make sure both parties are comfortable with the definition and the name is memorable. It's the job of both parties to keep an eye out for the argument. Whoever spots it first calls it out by name. Take a minute to realize this is a conversation that you've had before and remember what happened last time. Start your conversation from this point. Usually, by the time we get to the end of these conversations we're too exhausted to make real progress. By giving the conversation a name, you create a shorthand with your partner that allows you to skip redundancy and dive deeper into the issue.  submitted by /u/theresamouseinmyhous [link] [comments]
