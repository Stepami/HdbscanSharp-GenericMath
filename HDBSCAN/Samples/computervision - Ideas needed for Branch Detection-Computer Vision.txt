Ideas needed for Branch Detection-Computer Vision
I'm working on a product to detect and pick cotton from a cotton plant using a robotic arm. One of the difficulties is to plan a path such that there is no collision with the branches of the plant; but as of now, I haven't been able to accurately identify the branches. Using a line segment detector gives a fairly accurate results, but I'm looking for other ideas. Using a intel real sense 3d camera, and have worked with opencv c++, and PCL so far. I have access only to open source software.  submitted by /u/cottonplucking [link] [comments]
