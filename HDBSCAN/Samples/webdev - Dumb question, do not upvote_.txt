Dumb question, do not upvote.
I remember getting a link off of an old thread that I can no longer find. It was for a company that handles automatic deployments (I think) and they had kind of a crazy design. I remember a multi-colored fish and some squiggle lines. This company has changed their names a few times. This is all I can remember and it’s killing me that I can’t find it again and I’m hoping someone knows what I’m talking about! Thank you in advance. EDIT: Glitch.com!
