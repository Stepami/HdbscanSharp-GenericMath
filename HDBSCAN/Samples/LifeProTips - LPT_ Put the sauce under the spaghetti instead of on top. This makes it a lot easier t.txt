LPT: Put the sauce under the spaghetti instead of on top. This makes it a lot easier to mix evenly.
If you don't care about the aesthetics of the dish, it's a lot easier to mix it this way in my experience (and without spilling the sauce everywhere if you're as clumsy as I am). Also works with other dishes of course.  submitted by /u/tijgetje [link] [comments]
