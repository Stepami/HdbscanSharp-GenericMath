Letterkenny is such a great freakin' show.
I don't know why it's not more popular than it is. It's so rare to find a show that has great writing and a PHENOMENAL cast. I am so consistently impressed by the delivery of all the characters, even the small ones. Goddamn if you love "high-brow low-brow" humor, that is stupid shit with some witty, layered and quality dialogue, this show is for you. Watch it! Go!  submitted by /u/CreepyTarot [link] [comments]
