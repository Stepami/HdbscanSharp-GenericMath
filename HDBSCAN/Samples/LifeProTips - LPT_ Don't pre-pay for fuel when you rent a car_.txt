LPT: Don't pre-pay for fuel when you rent a car.
They make it seem like a great deal to buy your fuel at the rental car counter. It's more convenient because you don't have to stop at the gas station on the way and they offer their fuel and lower-than-market prices, so it's a great deal right? The fact that they carefully avoid is that when you pre-pay, you're paying for a full tank of gas regardless of how much you've used. If you return having used only 2 gallons out of a 16-gallon tank, you're still paying for 16 gallons. It's only a great deal if you bring it back running on fumes.  submitted by /u/LetReasonRing [link] [comments]
