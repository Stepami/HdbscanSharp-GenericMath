/u/PeteyG89 on Donald Trump Throws Paper Towels in Puerto Rico - Jimmy Kimmel Live
Where do I begin? She is a proven liar, has such a shady past, manipulates everyone. Nothing is ever her fault, im sure you read her book just released. Her campaign obviously conspired to deny Bernie the nomination. She says shes for the people yet takes big money from banks to give speeches. The Clinton foundation is a scam and full of shady dealings. And like it or not, she did play a part in Benghazi going south like it did. Shes qualified alright, shes qualified as to being the typical politician, shady and corrupt while putting a mask on to the public that is just so pathetic and fake. And her husband was impeached but lets get another Clinton in the white house, makes sense. If you voted for her, I guess you live up to that username, mistake prone. Theres a reason she lost to somebody as unqualified as Trump, face it. She was a horrendous candidate but everyone on the left (including Bernie) fell in line like the good little sheep they were and backed the fraud.
