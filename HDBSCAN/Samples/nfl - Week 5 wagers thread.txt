Week 5 wagers thread
As mods we don't have any recourse in dealing with people who don't own up to bets (our simple suggestion is be a man/woman of your word or stay out of the thread) but this doesn't make witchhunting and gang mentality okay. Please refrain from such things. Do call out users in these threads, but not every time they post. Thanks. pay up bets from Week 4 set new wagers for Week 5. call out those that haven't paid up yet.
