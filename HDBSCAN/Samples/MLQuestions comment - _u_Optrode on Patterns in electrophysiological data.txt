/u/Optrode on Patterns in electrophysiological data
Hi, I do single unit ephys. The most important question is this: What kinds of coding do you expect to encounter / want to detect? Different types of statistical methods / decoding methods will be able to detect different types of neural coding. All else being equal, a method that is highly specific to the type of coding used by the neuron will outperform a method that can detect multiple types of coding. Jack of all trades is master of none, in this case. So, what kind of coding are you primarily expecting? Pure rate coding, rate envelope coding, etc.?
