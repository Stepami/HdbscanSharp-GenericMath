/u/TequilaCamper on Query to select all non-dba users from the database
As Rehd said, we need a little more definition on what you are trying to achieve. You might look at these though: select * from sysusers select * from sys.sysusers select * from sys.database_principals select * from sys.syslogins --instance level SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals If your definition of non-DBA has to do with the sysadmin server role, you might look at something like this (this finds the sa's- reverse the logic if you're looking for the non-sa's): select @@SERVERNAME as ServerName, name as LoginName, 'Windows User' as LoginType from [sys].[syslogins] where sysadmin = '1' and isntuser = 1 and isntgroup = 0 Hope that helps.
