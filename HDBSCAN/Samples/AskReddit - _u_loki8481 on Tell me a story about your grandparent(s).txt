after my grandmother (a Catholic) died, my grandfather (a Protestant cop) got absolutely shitfaced, drove down to the local Catholic church, and banged on the rectory door in the middle of the night until someone answered (reportedly including firing his gun off into the air to wake them up) he demanded to see the priest and have him convert and baptize him then and there so that he'd be able to join my grandmother in heaven when he died.
