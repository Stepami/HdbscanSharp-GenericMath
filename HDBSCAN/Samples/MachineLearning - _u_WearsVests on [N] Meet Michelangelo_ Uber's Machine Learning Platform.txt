/u/WearsVests on [N] Meet Michelangelo: Uber's Machine Learning Platform
I can answer for our company (not Uber). Existing tools offer nothing over free open source packages like auto_ml, while adding expense, and external dependencies (and generally speed slowdowns) More analytics, always. Assuming that the machine learning part is the hard part (it's not- data consistency, and integrating ML predictions into usable products and maintenance and explaining models to people is the hard work). They're different problems solvable by different skillsets. The feature stores part is a pretty standard data infra problem. The automl part is a pretty standard engineering/machine learning problem. Totally depends whom you ask, but you'll probably want different people working on the different parts. Personally, being an ML person, I think the data part's tougher. But given how few people have solved the automl part publicly, I'm guessing data people would probably give the opposite answer.  Full disclosure- I'm the author of auto_ml. We looked into a bunch of alternatives, but they were expensive, slow, and reduced our ability to customize. But no matter which automl package you choose, you should almost certainly be using one of them- it rapidly speeds up your iteration speed, reduces the space for possible errors, makes ML available to non-ML engineers (which means opening ML to people who know their particular datasets really well), and allows your ML engineers to avoid many of the crappy and repetitive parts of their jobs, and focus on the more interesting or custom parts. I'm also happy to chat more about what we're doing! Really happy to see more and more efforts in this space.
