I don't want a career. I don't care to climb the corporate ladder. I just want a decent paying job that doesn't make me miserable... Any suggestions?
Before I start I'd like to apologize if this is the wrong sub for this. I've studied IT, worked as a repair technician for a few years and currently in technical support. I don't want a job with a lot of responsibility but I want to work with computers and technology. I love working with tech but all the IT jobs I find either want me to be a genius expert who knows literally everything and have every single IT certification in existence... or a nobody at a call centre working with people rather than tech. What kind of job am I looking for? Help desk? Something in QA? Even those require 50 different certifications and years of experience according to the job postings. I'm so lost.  submitted by /u/thirdworldsociety [link] [comments]
