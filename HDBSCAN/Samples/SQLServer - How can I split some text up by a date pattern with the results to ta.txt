How can I split some text up by a date pattern with the results to ta
I have this string, which is stored in a text field. The process of storing this information has since changed, but I need this "legacy" information in place.  23.06.17 - As per quote #8918.1. 7m Swing STage to Positon 1. 05.07.17 Stripped and rebuilt boat ready for positon 4 but rained off. 05.07.17 Stripped and rebuilt boat ready for positon 4 but rained off. 06.07.17 - Completion of Swing Stage to Positon 4. 21.07.17 - Built Access Tower to get acess to roof. Got swing Stage onto roof. No access to building unable to get parapit clamps and wire up. 21.07.17 - Built Access Tower to get acess to roof. Got swing Stage onto roof. No access to building unable to get parapit clamps and wire up.  How would I split this text by the date fields into a table of results, so for every new date, a new row (including the date) is shown. So in the above case, there would be 6 rows?  submitted by /u/MrBoKu [link] [comments]
