/u/PopeADopePope on As a 19 year old who has only been watching the news actively for the last ~4 years it feels like the world is spiralling downwards (Trump, global warming, North Korea, economic crisis). Has it always been like this, or were there times in which the news/zeitgeist were generally more positive?
Uhh you're whining about Trump giving out supplies to people, and wanting them to have fun? No wonder you're so ignorant of basic concepts
