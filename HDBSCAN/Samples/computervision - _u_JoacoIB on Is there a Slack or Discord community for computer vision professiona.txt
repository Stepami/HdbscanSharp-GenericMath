/u/JoacoIB on Is there a Slack or Discord community for computer vision professionals/enthusiasts?
Since none of the mentioned channels seem to be accesible I created a new one. Here is the invite link. It won't expire so the channel is easier to join https://join.slack.com/t/computervisionclub/shared_invite/enQtMjUxMjY4ODQyMDgwLTVlMjVmMTZhYjA4NzEwMjMxNjQwMzAyOGQxMTUxODRlMjI2NmRmY2IwZmQyNDAwYzdiYmM1MjNiYzc3YTZlZGU
