[Poll]Data Analytics vs Parallel and Distributed Computing for MS degree focus
Here are the classes I'm debating between. In your opinion, which 10 classes would lead to the better career in the long term? I feel like the data analytics track would be good for theory, but I think the parallel computing track would be good for implementing the theory. Should I take a mix of both? Should I only do one or the other? Which would you do if you were going to apply for a job in 2 years?
