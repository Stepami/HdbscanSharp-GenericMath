[Help]Adding enum to array
Hello again csharpers I have ran into a problem, and perhaps I am going about this the wrong way, but I'd like some advice on a project which I am doing purely for fun: I'm making a poker hand generator and currently store all the cards in a enum with an appending value: ACE = 24 for example. I'd like to upon method call be able to add 2 cards to a player hand and store the value in an array, so that the hands can later be compared and the winner is decided. I have this loop: public static void GetHand() { //Randomly generate hands Random create_hand = new Random(); for(int i = 0; i < Hand.Length; i++) { //simple add to array Hand.ToArray(Convert.ToInt32(Hands)); } } (currently contains syntax error) the problem is I'd like to store both the card AND the appending value and as it stands I am only going to return the string value. "Hands" - this is the enum containing all the cards and their values "Hand" - this is an array with a capacity of 2, this is where the hand will be stored Does anyone have a better idea of how this could be achieved? using an ArrayList perhaps? I'd love to hear Many thanks, Elliot  submitted by /u/Elliotmon [link] [comments]
