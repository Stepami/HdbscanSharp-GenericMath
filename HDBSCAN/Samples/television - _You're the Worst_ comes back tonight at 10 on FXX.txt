"You're the Worst" comes back tonight at 10 on FXX
If you haven't seen the show it is amazing. It is currently on Hulu. It follows the relationship of Gretchen and Jimmy who are thirty-somethings in LA and are awful people. One of the funniest shows on US TV right now. The new season premieres on FXX tonight at 10.  submitted by /u/MaesterMagoo [link] [comments]
