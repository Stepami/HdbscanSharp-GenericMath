Sql 2012 service pack 3 fails to install
Hallo. Hope you can help. Im trying to install Sql 2012 Service Pack 3 on one of my servers, but it keeps failing. Tried via WU and manual install on the administrator account but no luck. When i look in the summary log: Exit error code: 1 Exit message: The required MSI package 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Setup Bootstrap\Update Cache\KB3045321\GDR\redist\VisualStudioShell\VC10SP1\vc_red.msi' doesn't exist. and sure enough that files does not exist in that dir. Do i have to download it or ? and where ?  submitted by /u/Iceremover [link] [comments]
