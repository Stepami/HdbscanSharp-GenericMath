I'm Matthew Michael Ritter a narrative designer whose made some weird games (Also I've worked at some weird places,Yahoo! Telltale, Adult Swim Games, Dark Horse Entertainment... others) AMA!
My short bio: Hey everyone! I'm a narrative designer, which is an annoying way of saying writer in the video game industry. Originally coined to basically give more 'weight' to the role of... designing narrative. I've written comics, books, that fluff you read in pen and paper RPG rules, those stupid websites that tell you how to do things in lists, movies, TV, video games, copy for the back of books, ghost writing, Hallmark Cards, commercials (though i don't think it got produced), and other things. I assume most people would be interested in my work as a professional video game writer. I'm not going to link to everything I've worked on or all my personal projects, as I'm not really here to promote myself.  The two projects I've worked on you're most likely to know are...  The Walking Dead (season 2, Telltale vidya game): http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/261030/  And Tales from the Borderlands (Also a Telltale Vidya game): http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/330830/  My most recent game is Dead Horizon which is free and ten minutes long and you get to be a cowgirl and shoot people in quickdraw duels, pew pew: http://store.steampowered.com/app/671700/Dead_Horizon/  You're free to ask about anything, though. I've worked on lots of stuff. My assumption would be that people are more curious about how one actually makes a living as a writer for video games. At least, that's the one I get a lot in the real world. Oh, I've been making a living by writing or creating in some way for over a decade. Which I think is cool.  I'm not famous. Though I've worked with a lot of famous people. I wear stupid hats as you'll see in my proof. I get fired a lot, I've probably had more jobs than you've had. I am also not a great speller and my use of commas is sometimes questionable, so go easy on me if you see the professional writer screw up either. (I've probably already done so at least once in this AMA intro, I'm not proof reading it) I think splitting infinitives is fine and to be is an unnecessary part of language. I also feel the semi colon is useful but not enough people know what it means to use and that makes me sad!  Ask me anything. Seriously. I'll try and answer everyone, not that I'm expecting a lot of questions.  PROOF I am me. https://imgur.com/a/Wkn3g see? That's me.
