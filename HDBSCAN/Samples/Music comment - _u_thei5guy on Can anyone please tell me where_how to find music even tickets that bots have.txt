/u/thei5guy on Can anyone please tell me where/how to find music even tickets that bots have eaten up in minutes please?
This is pretty common for all popular shows, here in the us the tickets show up on stubhub, craigslist, ebay.. You may want to post this in a London based sub to get pointed to reseller sites that can be trusted so you donâ€™t end up sending hundreds of dollars to scammers
