/u/Tychonaut on TIL Jews are often associated as scheming merchants who love money because in the Middle Ages Christians were forbidden to lend out money with interest, Jews were not.
But I think the whole dynamic of "Nazi vs Communist" is left out. At least from my education in Canada in the early nineties. The end of WWI, and the Communists in Germany, and the attempted revolution. And how the Nazis tied that to the Jews. That's a huge part of the whole situation, and I don't remember it getting covered at all. We got "WWI caused the economic collapse, and the Nazis blamed that on the Jews, because Jews were historically persecuted."
