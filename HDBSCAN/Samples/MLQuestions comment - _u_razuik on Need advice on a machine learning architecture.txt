Thanks for the reply. Your understanding of seems to be correct, I essentially need to categorize raw job titles. As far as the data set, we will be receiving many thousands of job titles. Additionally, we will not use every possible SOC code in the classification system for this model - a subset of most general occupation titles for each industry should do. As you mentioned, it has become apparent to me that curating a data set with pairs of job titles and appropriate SOC classifications will be the main task. Do you believe this is feasible? If so, would it even require a state of the art ML model or something more basic (like feed forward)?
