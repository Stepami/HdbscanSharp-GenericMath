BlueGriffon
I was wondering if anybody here uses BlueGriffon? I have a website where a client is using BlueGriffon to edit their website. Their license has expired and I've been attempting to reach BlueGriffon but haven't had any luck. I've emailed their support and tweeted them on Twitter but have had zero response. I'm starting to wonder if they went out of business.  submitted by /u/jaypat32 [link] [comments]
