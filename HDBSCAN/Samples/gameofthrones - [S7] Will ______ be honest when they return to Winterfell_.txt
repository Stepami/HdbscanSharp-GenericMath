[S7] Will ______ be honest when they return to Winterfell?
Jon is known as an incredibly honest person. In 7x07, they showed that Jon and Dany are in love with each other and also showed them finally giving in to their feelings and having sex. Are they now in a relationship, and if so, will it be public knowledge? The Northerners probably won't react too well to finding out that Jon bent the knee to Dany, especially if they realize he's also in love with her. So it would probably be in his best interest to keep quiet about it but we all know that Jon is very truthful and honest and even discloses details when they don't need to be told (telling about sleeping with Ygritte). So do you think when he arrives at Winterfell, he'll be honest about his relationship with Dany? Also, if he gets her pregnant, how do you think they'll react when they realize (assuming they don't know their true relationship with one another at this point). Will he be happy that he got the woman he loves pregnant or upset that he fathered a bastard?  submitted by /u/Sweety_Singh18 [link] [comments]
