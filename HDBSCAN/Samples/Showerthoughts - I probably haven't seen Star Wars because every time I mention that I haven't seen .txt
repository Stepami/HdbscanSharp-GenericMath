I probably haven't seen Star Wars because every time I mention that I haven't seen Star Wars I'm met with "You've never seen Star Wars?!?" instead of "Oh hey you can borrow my DVD collection it's great."
edit: I sense some butt hurt in this thread Guess what I also never watched Star Trek haha fight me bitch I already have your precious KARMA edit2: I am sorry about what I said about butt hurt. I understand the repercussions of my actions now as there is actual butt hurt in this thread now since my update. Edit 3: what's with some of you people? Seriously, lighten up. It's a great day!  submitted by /u/_Not_Bruce_Wayne_ [link] [comments]
