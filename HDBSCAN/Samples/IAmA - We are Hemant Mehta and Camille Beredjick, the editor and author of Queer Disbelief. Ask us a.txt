We are Hemant Mehta and Camille Beredjick, the editor and author of Queer Disbelief. Ask us anything!
Hemant Mehta is the editor of FriendlyAtheist.com, a YouTuber at the Atheist Voice channel, and a podcaster. Camille Beredjick is the author of GayWrites.org. Her work has appeared in The Advocate, In These Times, BuzzFeed, Time.com, and elsewhere. She studied journalism and gender studies at Northwestern University and lives in Brooklyn with her fianc√©e. We've just finished a new book called Queer Disbelief, about how the LGBTQ and atheist communities overlap, where the comparisons break down, how religion hurts (and helps!) LGBTQ people, and more. It's the culmination of more than a year's worth of research, interviews, and analysis. We're raising funds on Kickstarter to finish the project and would appreciate your support! Hemant is r/Mpromptu. Camille is r/camilleberedjick. Ask us anything! Proof UPDATE (3:25p ET): We will still be answering questions, albeit a bit more slowly. Thank you for the great ones so far. And please consider supporting our Kickstarter for Queer Disbelief, where Camille goes into tremendous depth on these issues. It's really a fantastic book and we can't wait for you to read it.  submitted by /u/Mpromptu [link] [comments]
