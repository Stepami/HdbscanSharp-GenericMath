/u/chitwin on Judge Accepts Arpaio Pardon, Dismisses Guilty Verdict
Dude calm down and let's unpack your craziness a little. Arpaio was conviticed of contempt of court. Where is the constitutional abuse? Contempt has nothing to do with the constitution. I'm all for limiting the power of the President and have been for a long time. And not just ones I voted against, all of them. Screaming "muh constitution" after years of trying to bend it under President Obama is a little funny to me.anyway go away back to esist or ets your screeching is old and annoying.
