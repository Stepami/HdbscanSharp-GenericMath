What model should I use?
I have been learning all I can about machine learning and now I want to apply it. I have type 1 diabetes and I want to make a program that, given my last 6 blood glucose numbers, will predict my next one. A typical data set might look like this: Inputs: *350 *331 *318 *309 *297 *286 Output: *279 I want to know what model I should use, and how much data I should collect for it to work. I would also like to output a percentage of "how sure" the program is of the number. Also, any suggestions on where to look to learn more would be appreciated.  submitted by /u/1ethanhansen [link] [comments]
