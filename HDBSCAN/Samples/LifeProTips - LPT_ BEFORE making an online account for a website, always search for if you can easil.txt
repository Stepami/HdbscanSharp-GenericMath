LPT: BEFORE making an online account for a website, always search for if you can easily delete the account should you want to.
Sometimes a website will refuse to delete your account, such as Tremor games or fandom. Similarly, before you start a free trial, see if there is a simple way to cancel a subscription. If people have had trouble with that trial, chances are they have taken to a forum to voice their concerns. May take more time, but worth it in the long run!  submitted by /u/LordDoubleChin [link] [comments]
