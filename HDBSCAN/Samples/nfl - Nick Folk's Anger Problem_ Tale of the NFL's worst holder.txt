Nick Folk's Anger Problem: Tale of the NFL's worst holder
I believe Nick Folk is a pretty average kicker but he is not as bad as what he has shown tonight. Last night during the game I was browsing some historical data and kind of realized something. Everywhere Bryan Anger has been, his kicker has statistically regressed in terms of field goal percentage. Could it be that for some reason Bryan Anger is unable to properly get in sync with his kickers and has a hard time setting the ball after a long snap? Let's look at the statistics. Year Kicker FGA FGM FG % XPA XPM XP %   2017 Nick Folk 11 6 54.5 9 7 77.8  2016 Roberto Aguayo 31 22 71 34 32 94.1  2015 Jason Myers 34 27 79.4 32 29 90.6  2014 Josh Scobee 26 20 76.9 23 23 100    The average NFL kicker's field goal percentage is 83.9 and it's obvious Anger's kickers who he holds for fall well under that. So is it just his ineptitude at holding causing this? Or does he have a curse that follows him that makes every one of his special team buddies suck? Since people are getting upset at me like I killed their dog, here's a disclaimer: This isn't a 100% serious post but made in jest. I don't actually think Anger's bad.  submitted by /u/RayOfSunshine243 [link] [comments]
