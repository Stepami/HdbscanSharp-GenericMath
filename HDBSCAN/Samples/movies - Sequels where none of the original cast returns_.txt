Sequels where none of the original cast returns.
When a movie makes a ton of money it's no surprised that studio execs will quickly scramble to see about getting a sequel greenlit, this can result in something awesome like The Empire Strikes Back or it could end up being more like Highlander: The Quickening, but what if the studio doesn't want or can't acquire the original cast? Does that doom the sequel from the get go? Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf was a sequel to Joe Dante's horror classic and despite that movie ending with an obvious sequel hook, with the character of evil werewolf Marsha surviving, the sequel ended up being about the lead characters brother. Apparently director Philippe Mora had asked the studio if he could go off and do his own thing with the series, and they agreed. The question is why? Doesn't seem like a fiscally responsible way to take a sequel. What other sequels ditch the original cast? And if so did they work?  submitted by /u/MovieMike007 [link] [comments]
