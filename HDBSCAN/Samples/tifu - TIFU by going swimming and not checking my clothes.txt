TIFU by going swimming and not checking my clothes
So last night I went swimming with a youth group in an outdoor pool. I forgot to change at my house so I just grabbed my swimsuit and ran out the door to make it on time. When I got there I went behind a little barn to change and almost got spotted so I hurried up and just grabbed my clothes and ran. Then I just put my clothes on a picket fence next to their garden. Then I swam for a couple hours. I switched into my other shorts and just grabbed my clothes in a pile not putting on my shoes cause one of my socks mysteryously disappeared. The moment I got home I ran up to my room and threw my clothes in my laundry basket and my shoes on the floor. Then I went downstairs to talk to my mom for about an hour then I went back to my room to change into my pajamas. As I took off my pants and was getting new ones on I tried to put my leg through the leg hole I goofed it and missed only to have my foot land on a freaking HUGE caterpillar. I almost fainted it was probably 4 inches long and had a circumference of about 1.5 inches. The worst part is that he was heading straight for my bed witch is on the floor. And I only squished half of him so his head was still writhing on the ground I swear I would have just ran outside screaming except for the fact that it was 10:30 at night and I live in a house with 7 kids and I would have woken them all up. So I used a Kleenex and grabbed him still moving and flushed him down the toilet. The next three hours of my night were spent cleaning my room the cleanest it's been in years. I was not taking any chances sleeping with any more of them in my room. I then proceeded to look him up on the internet. I forgot what he was exactly but he evolves into a hawk moth. I may never sleep again TL;DR TIFU BY GOING SWIMMING AND NOT CHECKING MY CLOTHES BRINGING A HUGE ASS WORM HOME  submitted by /u/watzeez [link] [comments]
