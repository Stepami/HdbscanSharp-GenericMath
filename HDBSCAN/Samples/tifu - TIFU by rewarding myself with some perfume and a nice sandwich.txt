TIFU by rewarding myself with some perfume and a nice sandwich
This didn't happen today, however, my wounds are still pretty fresh so I might as well share this story before I forget any of the very important details. So yesterday, I decided that I was a good and helpful member of society and as such, deserved a little treat. I went shopping, got myself a nice bottle of perfume and on my way home I popped into my favorite sandwich shop to buy some dinner. After I got home I put down my sandwich and perfume on the kitchen counter before taking off my outerwear and shoes to then return to my new possessions and enjoy them in the most comfortable way possible; semi naked and sockless. And this is where the fuck up happens. As I was lifting up my sandwich I knocked over the perfume bottle, which then proceeded to roll off of the kitchen counter, fall on the floor, break, cut open my right foot and spit a healthy amount of perfume into it, leaving me with the feeling of absolute defeat and the nicest smelling open wound I've ever had. I ate the sandwich crying on the kitchen floor. TL;DR Knocked over perfume bottle, broke it on my foot, filled my open wound with chemicals that are probably not intended to be in an open wound.  submitted by /u/lanskrimmalmo [link] [comments]
