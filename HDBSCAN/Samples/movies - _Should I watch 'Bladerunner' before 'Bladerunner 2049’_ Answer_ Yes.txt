"Should I watch 'Bladerunner' before 'Bladerunner 2049â€™?" Answer: Yes
In threads about 2049 a lot of people are asking if they should watch the first before watching this most recent realease. Aside from getting some background into the overall world, the original is a great movie that should be watched for its own merits anyway. I don't think anyone would say "no, don't bother."  submitted by /u/_S_A [link] [comments]
