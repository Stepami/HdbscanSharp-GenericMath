Quick (probably dumb) CSS/layout question
Hi everyone, I am working on a lab that requires a one-page design that is responsive. I am including an image gallery per the prompt, and for a while it sat neatly in a grid beneath my text content and form. However, now it wants to wrap around them and look dumb. Here is a link to the page as it currently is. If you don't feel like inspecting the source, here is index.html and here is styles.css. I tried adding more divs but I don't think I'm on the right track. Any way to add some space under the blurb about the cat and make the gallery sit in a box of its own?  submitted by /u/codythomashunsberger [link] [comments]
