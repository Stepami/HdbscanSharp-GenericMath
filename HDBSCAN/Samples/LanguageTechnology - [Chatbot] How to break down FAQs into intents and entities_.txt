[Chatbot] How to break down FAQs into intents and entities?
So for work we are starting to design a chatbot for an FAQ system. I have all of the questions and answers organized into general categories, but I wanted to get some ideas/second opinions on how to process everything to break down intents and entities. My first step was going to be taking each category and looking for the main verb in each question. Then, once I see the main verb in the question, extract the most significant nouns out of it and get a term frequency. I haven't done a whole lot of NLP so I don't know anything else I should do to it. I mean I know that if the same verb is extracted from multiple questions in one section and different nouns are pulled out (so verb1 in sentence 1 extracts a,b, and c while verb1 in sentence2 extracts b,d, and e), I could do some matching or something with a tf-idf vector, but I don't know what else I could do. Would anyone here have any ideas?  submitted by /u/TheLegendOfCode [link] [comments]
