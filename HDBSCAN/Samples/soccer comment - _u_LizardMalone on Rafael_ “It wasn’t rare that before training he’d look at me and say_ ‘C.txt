/u/LizardMalone on Rafael: “It wasn’t rare that before training he’d look at me and say: ‘Come on, go to the left wing.’ When that happened, I used to just look at him. Then he’d go: ‘I meant right wing, Rafael!’ It’s funny to remember it – Fergie is a special person in my life."
I mean, Lyon isn't a small club and he's a regular there. Bigger mark against his stature for me is that he's never broken into the Brazil setup.
