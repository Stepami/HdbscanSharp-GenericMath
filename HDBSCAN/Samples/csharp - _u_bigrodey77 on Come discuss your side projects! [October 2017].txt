Currently writing a mini command line app to demonstrate the different ways to unit test and mock C# code. I'm using CommandLineParser but there's a super annoying way it handles what I'm doing and IMO kind of defeats the purpose of using that in the first place. I'm going to give this a shot. Thanks!!
