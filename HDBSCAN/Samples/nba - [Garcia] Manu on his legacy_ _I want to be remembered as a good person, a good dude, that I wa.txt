[Garcia] Manu on his legacy: "I want to be remembered as a good person, a good dude, that I was around in town, fun to watch. But after a few years it'll be forgotten. The legacy thing is very overrated. If you live your life thinking about legacy or what you'll leave, then you add another concern."
