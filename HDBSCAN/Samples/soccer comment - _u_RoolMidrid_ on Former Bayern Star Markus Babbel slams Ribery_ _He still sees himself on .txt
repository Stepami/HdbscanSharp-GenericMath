/u/RoolMidrid_ on Former Bayern Star Markus Babbel slams Ribery: "He still sees himself on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi...For me, some Bayern players live too much in the past."
I mean you follow the rules some idiot wanting another option to control the society better set up some thousands of years ago  Thank you for proving my point idiot ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Please go educate yourself before regurgitating shit you clearly don't understand. And also guess what, chances are you follow the rules you bitch about because religion vastly changed the world for the better, from hospitals to universities to how we keep track of time. So fuck off to /r/atheism you uneducated fool I won't waste more time on you. You're not educated enough to try and argue with a religuous person.
