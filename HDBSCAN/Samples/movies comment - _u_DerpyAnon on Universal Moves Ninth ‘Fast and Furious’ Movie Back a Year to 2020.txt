/u/DerpyAnon on Universal Moves Ninth ‘Fast and Furious’ Movie Back a Year to 2020
Vin Diesel is looking like a bruised potato with each year gone by. The family thing is weird and cringey, because he was an antagonistic asshole in the first few movies, then becomes a mother hen in the later ones? I feel like Vin Diesel might be jealous about the reception of Hobbs/Shaw and how people like those characters better than Dominic. He's probably gritting his teeth at the thought of a spin-off.
