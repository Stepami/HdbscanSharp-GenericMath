I need to create a repeatable export from SQL 2000
We are migrating our accounting system to another system and I need to export a number of different basic queries, mostly date filters and some basic joins to either Excel or a CSV. I need to do this once for the initial testing and then will need to do it a final time with some possible tweaks in the middle for testing. Is there a free/open source tool that can store or read these queries and redo the exports easily? I know that there are paid tools to do similar, but we only really need to do this for this one instance and then I will not have a need for this again, if there is nothing free I will probably just do it manually.  submitted by /u/TTSkipper [link] [comments]
