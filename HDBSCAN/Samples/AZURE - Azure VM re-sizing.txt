Azure VM re-sizing
So the Azure Advisor has indicated that there are several VMs that can be resized, and sure enough, after investigation, it turns out the VMs may not actually be used currently - it also indicates an initial cost saving - however, it doesn't seem to tell me what VM size it recommends to get those cost savings - at least not that I can see, I can work this out however just wondering if I missed it. So x3 questions: Does the Azure Advisor indicate what VM size it recommends to downsize to, if so where in the panel? I can't seem to find any cmdlets for Azure Advisor in the AzureRM module, was hoping to bring this information into a daily report is this the case - at least for now? Is there a better/third party free way of looking at overall Azure VMs and possibly savings outside of the Advisor?   submitted by /u/ChevronX [link] [comments]
