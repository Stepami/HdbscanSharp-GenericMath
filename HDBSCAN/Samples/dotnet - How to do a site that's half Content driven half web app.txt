How to do a site that's half Content driven half web app
So basically I have a company intranet site that is mostly used for downloading paystubs, support tickets, and HR forms. It's also intended to be used as a corporate news and events landing page, something that we'd like to accomplish with a cms so we can put it in the hands of another department. My ideal situation would be that you could have a page or group of pages that had some sort of tag that says they're content driven and other pages that just operate like basic mvc. Does something like that exist? Do I need to create two separate pages? That would be a bitch for auth. Is it worth the time to just implement a custom cms?  submitted by /u/cardsfan3 [link] [comments]
