Can a company that built my website charge me for a Wordpress update that broke it?
Sorry if the title is a bit confusing. I am looking for advice as I do not know what is common in the industry. What happened: I pay a company to build a website for me  They deliver a Wordpress-based website, and let me know that any further changes I want them to make require further payment  Recently, some functionality started working differently (i.e. wrongly) on my website. When contacted, the company told me it was because Wordpress had updated therefore causing the bug, and that to fix it I'd have to pay the company!   Is this reasonable?? I'm not in the webdev industry but right now I'm thinking: I didn't ask for a Wordpress update, so why did I get one? Is this normal? Doesn't all code get frozen on release? Surely the Wordpress update wasn't forced upon the company, so the company must've initiated the update right? And if this was the case, then shouldn't the company fix it without charge? If I initiated the update, then I would understand if I had to pay as it was my request. But here nothing was done on my end yet I'm expected to pay to fix this update that happened on their end??  submitted by /u/Gn5y4Oz5KPtjaslMZHG2 [link] [comments]
