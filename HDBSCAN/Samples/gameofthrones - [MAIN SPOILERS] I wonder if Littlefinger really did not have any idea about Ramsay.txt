[MAIN SPOILERS] I wonder if Littlefinger really did not have any idea about Ramsay
So we know saying that he was a selfish power hungry man is putting it lightly. He had a vast network of spies all around the seven kingdoms and beyond. So when he arranged for Sansa to wed Ramsay, did he really not know anything about him? Would he not have put his spies to work immediately to find out information about Roose Bolton’s Bastard? Also, even though he was bastard, everyone was petrified of him from a young age(as he mentions to the maester). So wouldn’t he have a reputation enough to get word to Littlefinger? Little finger mentions to Ramsay that he knows very little about him which I find hard to believe. But simultaneously, I do think he felt some level of affection for Sansa. Would he give her away to such a man if he knew about him before hand just to gain power in the north?  submitted by /u/a9s8u [link] [comments]
