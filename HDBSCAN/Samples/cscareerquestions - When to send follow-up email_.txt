When to send follow-up email?
Hi CSCQ, I have just had an on-campus interview, when should I send a follow-up email and what should I include in the email? Is something like: "Thank you for taking the time to interview me. Hope to hear from you soon!" appropriate?  submitted by /u/Shiafiku [link] [comments]
