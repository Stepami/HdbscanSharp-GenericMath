The GAM Strategy
When the coach for GAM said he was going to show a way League of Legends has never been played before I believe he was being serious. Unfortunately GAM's strategy fell apart early on and wasn't able to be executed in the way they had planned. They placed Lucian and Tristana in solo lanes in an attempt to acclerate their EXP and Gold income that way both of their carries would be higher level than the LZ carries. Meanwhile Mordekaiser and Karma went to farm bot and sit at tower. Finally having Cho'Gath in the jungle leads towards very good early objective taking due to Cho'Gath's ultimate dealing 1000+ true damage at level 6. The planned strategy was as follows: Have leads on both of their ADCs due to having them in solo lanes, meanwhile they have Mordekaiser on the bottom half of the map where the dragon pit is. When Mordekaiser and Cho'Gath both hit six the strategy comes online where Cho'Gath would take one or both of the ADC's to take Rift Herald much quicker than usual by using the smite + Feast combo then immediately run to Dragon and group as five killing dragon and giving Mordekaiser the ghost. Then they would five man mid, use herald, dragon ghost, and two stronger carries to quite literally bully their way down the mid lane in an attempt to grab an inhibitor in the first 15 minutes of the game. The strategy fell apart when LZ very intelligently responded by four man ganking bot when Mordekaiser and Karma were level 1 setting them behind and taking away the tower denying them the ability to sit there until six as well as the mechanically failed gank in mid by Levi where he flashed before Ryze had, then missed the knock up after Ryze used the flash. This is my take on the GAM strategy and what was planned and until the coach or players give more insight in interviews I believe this is what the intended result was meant to be. This time without a spoiler in the title ;)  submitted by /u/YumeLoL [link] [comments]
