/u/AllThatIsMeh on Changing behaviors may be easier when people see norms changing - "In a study, people ate less meat and conserved more water when they thought those behaviors reflected how society is changing."
It would be a lot easier on vegetarians if they would stop the finger wagging. I was raised on red meat, literally, being from a southern state with lots of cattle. People aren't going to change overnight, and a vegetarian diet makes me literally ill. (save me the "you're not doing it right" lectures too)
