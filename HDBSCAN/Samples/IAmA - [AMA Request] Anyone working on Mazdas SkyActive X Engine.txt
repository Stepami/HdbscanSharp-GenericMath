[AMA Request] Anyone working on Mazdas SkyActive X Engine
My top 5 questions would be: 1) What was/is your job at the engine? 2) How did you come up with idea of an auto igniting petrol engine? 3) Isn't the problem that you need less fuel at the cost to have way higher emissions? 3.1a) If so: whats the advantage? 3.1b) If not: Why? Do you filter it? 4) Is it way harder to control auto igniting petrol engines compared to Diesel engines? 5) What was the (feeled) ratio of older experienced engineers to younger less experienced engineers?  submitted by /u/ChrizZly1 [link] [comments]
