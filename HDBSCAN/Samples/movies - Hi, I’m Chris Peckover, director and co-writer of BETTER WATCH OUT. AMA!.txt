Hi, I’m Chris Peckover, director and co-writer of BETTER WATCH OUT. AMA!
Hey y'all, Chris Peckover here. BETTER WATCH OUT, our dark comedy/horror/thriller starring the intensely talented Olivia DeJonge, Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould, Patrick Warburton, and Virginia Madsen hits theaters and on demand today. If you’ve seen the movie, you know it hinges on some pretty major twisterinos, so be kind to your fellow Redditors who haven’t seen it yet. That said - if you have a burning question, I’ve got a gushing firehose answer and more awkward analogues where that came from. Check out the trailer here — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88Z3Xa9v4s Get tickets to BETTER WATCH OUT here — http://wellgousa.com/theatrical/better-watch-out Proof: https://twitter.com/peckover/status/915637537514721280  submitted by /u/chrispeckover [link] [comments]
