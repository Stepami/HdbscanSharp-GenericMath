/u/dYz on Patterns in electrophysiological data
Hi. Sounds like a very interesting project. Disclaimer, I do not a have a math background but I have worked with mvpa and MEG/EEG data for some years now. I'm not entirely sure I completely understand the question you are asking for help with. But if it is a simple classification of correct/incorrect a logistic regression is a good starting place and easier to interpret than a svm. But more information might help to give a more specific answer. I would recommend starting with scikit-learn for python. That's a very good library with a lot of great tutorials etc.
