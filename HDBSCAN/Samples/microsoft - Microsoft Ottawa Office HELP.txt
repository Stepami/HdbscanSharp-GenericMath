Microsoft Ottawa Office HELP
I've been trying to reach a human being at the Microsoft Canada Ottawa office on three separate calls and been on hold for upwards of an 45 minutes each time. This is not an issue of support or parts. I need to speak to someone in office. I'm calling from a Partner vendor and have questions about an upcoming event but do not have specific contact information so I'm trying to reach a general help line!  submitted by /u/hamiltonthrowaway1 [link] [comments]
