What's the next stage of getting into computer security?
I've finished my third year at Uni and have completed a module in computer security. Here are some of the topics covered: Authorization, Authentication and Access control, constructing RBAC models, Symmetric encryption and common ciphers, and how to construct basic symmetric encryption schemes with relevant set theory. Assymetric encryption, RSA (with relevant number theory), DES, cryptographic hashes, and hash functions Public Key Infrastructures, signing and verification, certificates, trust models, certification standards like X.509, CRLs, key escrow Key establishment protocols with corresponding attacks, such as COA, KPA, Lowe's Attack, replay, oracle, binding, Diffie Hellman attacks etc. Basic application security guidelines.  The course itself was quite theoretical, which was great for me, but I'm finding that in practice on real machines these concepts seem a lot more enigmatic. Now I'm at a stage where I've developed a thirst for more technical security knowledge and practical experimentation (legal, obviously). Where would be a good place to start / books to check out for getting deeper into this stuff? I've heard about the Cicada 3301 game and how participants were required to write RSA breakers for smaller prime numbers in python. Something like this sounds very interesting and I'm enthusiastic for that kind of thing. Cheers  submitted by /u/C0ltFury [link] [comments]
