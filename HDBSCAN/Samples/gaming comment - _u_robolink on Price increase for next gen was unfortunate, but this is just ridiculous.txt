/u/robolink on Price increase for next gen was unfortunate, but this is just ridiculous
Sales tax ya? So more like 10usd more, you're basically paying 70 after tax where we pay 65. Give or take a buck or two? I mean its a different country, I realize you are all used to the old prices but it seems like Canadians arereally angry over having to pay 6 bucks more than Americans. I know people in Australia that pay literally double for games, that shits bad. I just never quite understood all the rage though in Canada.
