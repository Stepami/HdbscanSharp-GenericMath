/u/epitone on Overwhelmed by job search/interview prep
The problem is I just can't be motivated to study. I keep trying to think of the end goal of getting a job but just grinding through problems for hours on end day in and day out makes me feel like I'm dying from the inside out. It's not fun at all. I got into this field because I enjoyed coding and programming but this is just...killing it for me. But I don't have any other skills. A classmate referred me to the company he works for in a glorified secretary position and I'm praying to God that something comes of it just so I can be doing something
