LPT: Understand that 99% of the time, questioning "how" to do something, is just a form of avoidance.
Everytime you think to yourself; "I'd really like to be able to write.", "I wish I could talk to this girl.", etc. You are basically just avoiding the task. It's really easy to do this in the age of the Internet as well. There is an endless ocean of self-help articles, guides, etc that you can get lost in reading without really yielding any long-lasting insights. Most insights come from experience, or information with relation to experience. Understand that, recognize that, and never question the "proper" way to do something, just do it-- Like how humans got things done before we were flooded with distractions.  submitted by /u/MonoWill [link] [comments]
