/u/Izento on HTC Off the Map: Lustboy
Damn. Mad respect for Lustboy. It sounds like he retired due to thinking his own play was slipping (honestly think he could have powered through) and was too burnt out to continue the grind. I respect him though for knowing that he didn't want to continue and he would be a hindrance to his own team at some point. That's some real self reflection and it takes a big person to make that acknowledgement, just like Dyrus.
