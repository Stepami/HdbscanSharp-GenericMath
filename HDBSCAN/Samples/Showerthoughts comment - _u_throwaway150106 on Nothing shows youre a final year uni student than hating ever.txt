/u/throwaway150106 on Nothing shows youre a final year uni student than hating every other fucking student
Thanks for making suggestions, it means a lot. Unfortunately, 1) They are definitely stoners because I can smell the smoke from inside my flat and it's making me nauseous. 2) I did have a friendly word with them, but they point blank refused to be quieter. And I'm talking about being able to feel the bass line through the soles of my feet. They just suggested I put on my own music (thus spreading the misery to my downstairs neighbour...) 3) They are the sort who massage their balled fists in conversation, deliberately slur their speech and talk in artificially ultra deep voices, they're just the most spoilt, narcissistic, self-centred, psychopathic twats imaginable and I wouldn't put serious assault past them. And the police don't care until it's too late. They just seem to have completely different standards on what's acceptable. I wouldn't dream of doing what they do, I go out of my way to be as quiet as possible for downstairs, it's just basic decency but they have absolutely no empathy they're like three year-old kids it's scary as fuck. Still, jokes on them when their standards didn't include burning the house down with us all inside it.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
