[Main Spoilers] Aegon Targaryen vs The Drowned God
Alright so this is just some thought I had yesterday and Im sorry if its already been posted. Do you guys remember the one episode in seven 7 where Sam tries to convince the maesters that the army of the dead is real? Well as the maesters are mocking sam, one mentions that "the drowned god was supposed to rise up and kill Aegon Targaryen." Know that it is known that Jon snow's real name is Aegon Targaryen, do you think it is possible he dies by the hands of the drowned god? Who do you guys think the drowned god is? I think Theon is a possibility because of his resilience when it comes to dying. Here is a link to the scene Im referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIv1MD2KzW8 The line I'm basing this idea off of is said at 2 minutes 35 seconds.  submitted by /u/Lance_Magoo [link] [comments]
