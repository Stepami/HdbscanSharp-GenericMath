Is there any hacky or crappy workaround using Process or ProcessStartInfo that will let me determine if an external console process written in vc++ has thrown an exception?
because obviously this is helpful. It's really fantastic that a console application written in visual c++ doesn't throw exceptions and fail through a standard error stream. It's enough of a GUI that it throws outside the console streams, but not enough of a GUI where I could wait for input idle. The worst possible, and only, solution I can think of is to put some type of time boundary on it. Is there a less terrible way? Please note that I don't care what the exception is, just that the execution will not continue (and I can log it and move to the next batch). Please also assume that I cannot ensure that the external console application would ever be suitably modified to correctly catch its own exceptions and exit with a failure exitcode.  submitted by /u/toolongdontread [link] [comments]
