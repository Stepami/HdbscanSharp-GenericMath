Server Report builder help with expression
So, I've been tasked with setting up a report that visually changes based on an expression. The first part says if number is less than 110 display Red fill, else if number is between 111 and 139 display Yellow fill, or else if number is over 140 display green. I think I over thought the problem or my between expression is not working because anything over 140 it still yellow, and everything below 110 is red.  =SWITCH(First(Fields!Line_1_Float.Value, "CSSFLOAT_TOP") < 110, "Red", First(Fields!Line_1_Float.Value, "CSSFLOAT_TOP") > 111, "Yellow" and First(Fields!Line_1_Float.Value, "CSSFLOAT_TOP") < 139, First(Fields!Line_1_Float.Value, "CSSFLOAT_TOP") > 140, "Green")   submitted by /u/eqtitan [link] [comments]
