/u/akcaye on When nobody on the enemy team is wearing headphones
... you play music while playing the game with hands down the best sound design in history. I'm disappointed. Even playing without headphones feels like not looking at the screen at all. I always feel like I have no idea what's going on. The information you get from sound in this game is insane.
