[AMA Request] Robyn Wright
My 5 Questions: What is your favourite moment from working with Kevin Spacey?  If you could take a role in any other TV show, which show would it be and what role would you take?  If you could reshoot any scene from House of Cards, whether it be because you don't like how you acted/seemed, or it be that you enjoyed it so much, what scene would you choose?  Out of all your performances, what has been the most rewarding for your experience and your life in general?  Is there a role you regret signing up for, or regret not signing up for? And if so, what roles were they?   Public Contact Information: https://twitter.com/realrobinwright?lang=en  submitted by /u/SpecifiedLemon [link] [comments]
