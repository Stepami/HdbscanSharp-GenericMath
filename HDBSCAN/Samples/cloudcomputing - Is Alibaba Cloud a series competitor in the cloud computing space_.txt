Is Alibaba Cloud a series competitor in the cloud computing space?
I understand there is going to be a no clear winner in the cloud space. (Though AWS is always the pioneer or the leader). Looking at the Alibaba cloud, i see they have been doing well lately. Is anyone using their service and how is their range or products?  submitted by /u/vira28 [link] [comments]
