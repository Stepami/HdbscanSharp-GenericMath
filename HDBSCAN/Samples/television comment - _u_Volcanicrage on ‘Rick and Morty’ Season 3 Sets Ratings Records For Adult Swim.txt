/u/Volcanicrage on ‘Rick and Morty’ Season 3 Sets Ratings Records For Adult Swim
I think the problem is that after The Ricklantis Mixup, anything was going to feel like a letdown, but Ricklantis would never work as a finale. Its probably the best episode of the show ever, but its completely detached from the main events of the season-long metaplot, and doesn't directly effect C137 R&M's storyline (yet).
