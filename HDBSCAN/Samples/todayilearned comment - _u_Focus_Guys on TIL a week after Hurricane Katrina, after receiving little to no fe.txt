/u/Focus_Guys on TIL a week after Hurricane Katrina, after receiving little to no federal supplies, Sheriff Billy McGee stole 2 FEMA trucks full of ice from a U.S. military base to give to the citizens of Forrest County, MS.
TLDR drop the criminal charges but reimburse the soldier for his injuries. In a state of emergency (SOE) declared by the Governor and President, normal rules don't apply. During SOE soldiers are often marshalled , given federal law enforcement authority. This means that rank doesn't really matter but jurisdiction. The sheriff doesn't have jurisdiction on a federal installation. So even in a normal scenario the sheriff is just a dude with a gun. Also being a sheriff doesn't give him the power to just take shit. The CPT is a federally appointed officer working along side FEMA as the DOD does. He definitely had authority over those trucks. That being said drop the criminal charges Katrina was a fucking rough situation, but the city should be civilly held responsible to pay for that soldier's injuries because he was arrested illegally.
