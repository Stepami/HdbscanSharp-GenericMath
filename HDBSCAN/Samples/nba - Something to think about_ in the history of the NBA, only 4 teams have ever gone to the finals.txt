Something to think about: in the history of the NBA, only 4 teams have ever gone to the finals 4 straight times (celticsX2, Lakers, Heat) and LeBron James has a chance to do it for the second time in his career.
Also, we might have 2 teams do it in the same year. Pretty crazy times in the nba. Obviously this is a big assumption. But it really puts in perspective how unheard of LeBron and the warriors aware right now.  submitted by /u/blacksteel367 [link] [comments]
