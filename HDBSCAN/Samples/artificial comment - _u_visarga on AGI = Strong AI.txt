/u/visarga on AGI = Strong AI
If you want to learn an AI term, try "reinforcement learning". It's the kind of AI that might become AGI. Deep learning is just a tool used for that end. Reinforcement learning is the idea of learning by moving about in the world (or in a sim, or in a game), solving tasks. In RL there is an agent, the agent perceives the world around it, then selects and performs actions. Actions have external effects and, from time to time, generate "rewards". The reward signal is used to learn good from bad behavior. In a nutshell, RL is what humans, animals and some bots do to behave intelligently and maximize their goals. An RL agent learns from "blank slate" only by perception and rewards - it does not need to be taught how to act directly. It's a universal learning & acting system, based on the "perception-judgement-action-reward loop". A famous RL system is AlphaGo. Self driving cars are also RL agents. Whenever you see AGI, think "advanced RL on par with humans".
