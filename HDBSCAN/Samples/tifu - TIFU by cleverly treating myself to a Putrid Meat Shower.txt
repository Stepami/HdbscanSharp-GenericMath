TIFU by cleverly treating myself to a Putrid Meat Shower
So some jerk at work cleared their raw mince beef cookery scraps away by forcing them down the kitchen sinkâ€™s plug hole. Fast forward 2 days and the meat is now stinking out the kitchen and the sink is not draining. There being no plunger to hand, I poked a straightened clothes hanger through the clogged plug hole which eventually allowed the water to flow (but the meat tangle remained- stench now increasing). Quite the quandary! Always one to think outside of the box, I had one of my brightest flashes of brilliance. Grabbing the kitchen fire extinguisher (carbon dioxide), I formed a tight seal over the plug hole and gave one good pump. A high powered jet of co2 gas to the rescue! Instant success - meat obstruction promptly clears the plug hole - some down the pipe but a remarkable portion exits via the overflow drain and sprays me face to waist with lumps of rancid meat. tl;dr : buy a plunger  submitted by /u/Youghal [link] [comments]
