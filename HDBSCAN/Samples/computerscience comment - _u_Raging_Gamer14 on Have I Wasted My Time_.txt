/u/Raging_Gamer14 on Have I Wasted My Time?
Thanks a lot! I definitely feel as though I am a good problem solver, partly because of my math background as well as programming. I just hope that as long as I have a good foundation I'll be OK. I've just always had the fear I'll go blank on a question that I should have learned the answer to on day one in college.
