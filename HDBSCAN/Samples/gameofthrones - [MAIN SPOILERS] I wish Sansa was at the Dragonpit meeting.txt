[MAIN SPOILERS] I wish Sansa was at the Dragonpit meeting
Brienne/Hound was great, but I would've traded that and a relatively tame Brienne/Jaime interaction for Sansa reuniting with Cersei, Tyrion, and the Hound, Sansa meeting Dany and seeing dragons for the first time, Sansa seeing the wight and finally understanding what Jon has been fighting against, and Sansa's reaction to Jon bending the knee to Dany.  submitted by /u/JohnSmithSensei [link] [comments]
