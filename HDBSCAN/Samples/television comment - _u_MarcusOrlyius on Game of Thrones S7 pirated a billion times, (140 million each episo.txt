I never said it was hard. If you haven't got much content though then you don't really need a media library manager because you're likely to know what all the content is. In that case, you may as well just use VLC. When you've got shitload of content (as in as much as or more than Netflix) having a good media library provides you with info about the shows so you don't need to look it up on the web. As for the streaming aspect, I'm not really interested in it. I watch live sports using the Acestream player and torrent everything else.
