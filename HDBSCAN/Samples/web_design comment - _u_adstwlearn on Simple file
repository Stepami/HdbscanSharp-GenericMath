Yup - that's the right result. There's a few a different placeholder-images that represent different special upload types - pdf, video, multiple-images, etc. It also shows you how many files you've selected. Your initialized FileUploadWithPreview object will contain an array of the selected images. In the future I plan to add a feature that shows you a list of the selected images in the case of a multiple file upload. Thanks for checking it out.
