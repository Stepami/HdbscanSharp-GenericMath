Computer Vision / Environment Mapping Question
Hello, I have a project where I want to mount a camera over a table, take a picture, detect shapes, and then convert the positioning of those shapes into cutting instructions for a CNC machine. I have the code to detect the shapes and find the coordinates within the image and it works pretty well. Now I need to figure out how to mount a camera and then map the image to the table. I am hoping someone with some experience in computer vision can point me in the right direction for learning how to do this. I'm not sure how you would go about positioning the camera to get accurate and repeatable results. Any help is greatly appreciated!  submitted by /u/TheJamaican [link] [comments]
