[D] Will it be useful to have an 'idea bank' website like polymath project ? People can post ideas and co-work projects/papers online.
In this way, it might accelerate the development of algorithms, or not ? Since anyone can propose new idea in real-time and get feedback/collaboration/criticize also in real-time.  submitted by /u/xingdongrobotics [link] [comments]
