/u/hack-man on LPT: If you are riding a bike, ride with traffic. If you are walking, always walk on the sidewalk; if there is no sidewalk, walk against traffic.
When I was in Elementary School (early 1970s) we had police come in one day to give us Bicycle Safety tips. The only one I remember is that we were told to always ride on the sidewalk, and only bike on the street if there wasn't a sidewalk. What's strange is that my older brother said that when they got the Bicycle Safety tips (mid 1960s, same school) he was told to NEVER ride a bicycle on the sidewalks and to ALWAYS use the streets. This was in a town that didn't have "bicycle paths" and none of the streets had "bicycle lanes" so the only options were to ride on the sidewalk or on the street.
