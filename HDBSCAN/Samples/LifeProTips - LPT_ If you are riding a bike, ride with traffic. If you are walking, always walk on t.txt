LPT: If you are riding a bike, ride with traffic. If you are walking, always walk on the sidewalk; if there is no sidewalk, walk against traffic.
This may be common sense for the majority of the older generation, but I see far too many teens/kids walking with traffic or biking against traffic. I watched a young boy barely avoid death the other day because he wasn't following these rules. EDIT: Wording EDIT #2: u/ibanezrocker724 explained why perfectly. "Bicyclists can hit speeds in excess of 30mph if the traffic is approaching you head on at 50mph you now have a closure rate of 70mph. If you are riding with traffic you have a closure rate of 20mph. Get some mirrors on your helmet or your handlebars. Ride on appropriate roads. Wear bright colors. Have a light on the back of your bike and follow the rules and be predictable and you will be fine." EDIT #3: For those of you still refuting this LPT, u/jurassicbond commented a great article here: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-safer-to-ride-your-bike-with-traffic-or-against-it  submitted by /u/DootMasterFlex [link] [comments]
