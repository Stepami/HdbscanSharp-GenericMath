I made a Twitter bot that tweets everytime your internet connection goes down
Hi, my internet sucks and today I had a free day so I decided to make a bot that tweets everytime your internet connection goes down. It may not be the best solution but at least is fun, by default, you have to set the Twitter API keys and your ISP name, set debug to false and you're good to go. It will tweet something like: #Comcast's Internet just went down for 2 minutes and 39 seconds. From 21:05:31 to 21:08:10. It's the 10ยบ time. You can of course tweak it or do anything you want with it. I tried to tidy up the code that initially was a mess, but it may contain errors or some inconsistent stuff so feel free to send a pull request or fork it or whatever. Link to repository: https://github.com/tyrellrummage/internet-downtime-twitter-bot Also it's the first time a share a repository that is not a github page so comment if there's something wrong with the way I did it please! To run it, go the the same directory (folder) where you have it and run node app.js (with the console).  submitted by /u/tyrellrummage [link] [comments]
