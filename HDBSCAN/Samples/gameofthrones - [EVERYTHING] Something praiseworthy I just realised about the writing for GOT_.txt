[EVERYTHING] Something praiseworthy I just realised about the writing for GOT.
The show does an excellent job of giving us a picture/info of the past, while BARELY using flashbacks and generally avoiding exposition dumps.. Really think about how much we know about the recent history of Westeros, and then think of how sparse the occasions were when we had that info delivered via flashback, there's what? 5-10 in the entire series? even with Bran's visions being counted? The praiseworthy factor is how well information is woven into scenes without being rammed down your throat or you being taken to one side, as the plot stops dead to have info given to you.  submitted by /u/omnipotentmonkey [link] [comments]
