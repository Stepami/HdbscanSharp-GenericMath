/u/Plutos_Not_A_Planet on LPT: Don't train for multiple departments at a grocery store. They will work you twice as hard and give you the same pay. For example, they will have you work produce and dairy in the same day. The exception to this would be if you are able to negotiate a pay raise first.
If you're a cashier for example you often get paid less than someone who works in a "fresh department" so the company is essentially paying less for more skilled labor.
