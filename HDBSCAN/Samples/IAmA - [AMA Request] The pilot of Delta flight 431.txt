[AMA Request] The pilot of Delta flight 431
Who made the final call to both land and take off again with a Category 5 hurricane bearing down? In my head, there's a movie star handsome rogue pilot who says, "I can do this", but I doubt that's how it works lol. How long have you been flying? Is this the most dangerous commercial flight you have piloted? Was there ever any real risk that the flight wouldn't make it through, or was it so meticulously planned that all there was was to do it? Were the passengers warned before boarding or was the flight treated normally? Did you very calmly warn the passengers of slight turbulence?  submitted by /u/MonarchicalLlama [link] [comments]
