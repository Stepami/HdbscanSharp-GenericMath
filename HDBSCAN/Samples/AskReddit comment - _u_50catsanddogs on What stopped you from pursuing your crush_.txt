/u/50catsanddogs on What stopped you from pursuing your crush?
This doesnt make it ok but I can think of a couple of times my knee jerk reaction when someone suggested I date a guy in front of him was to squeal 'no way' out of awkwardness and immaturity. It had nothing to do with the guy and at least once I definitely regretted it.
