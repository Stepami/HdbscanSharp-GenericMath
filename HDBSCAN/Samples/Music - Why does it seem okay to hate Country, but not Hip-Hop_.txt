Why does it seem okay to hate Country, but not Hip-Hop?
I'm sure many of you have heard from people, whether online, or in person "I'll listen to anything but country" and occasionally you will get the whole, no country or rap thing. More no country though. I guess this is more specifically online, but if you say you can't stand country, you'll get plenty of upvotes and/or agreeing posts, but if you say the same thing for hip-hop, you'll be downvoted into oblivion and have tons of people telling you about what you gotta listen to. Why is this though? Why is it okay to shit all over Country that isn't Johnny Cash, but not Hip-Hop? I'm not bashing rap or country, I'm just legitimately curious.  submitted by /u/toadfan64 [link] [comments]
