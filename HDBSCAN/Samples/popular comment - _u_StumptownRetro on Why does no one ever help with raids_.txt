/u/StumptownRetro on Why does no one ever help with raids?
I generally raid with my Clan, and because of how broken Guided Games are, that may not change. Just as well, this raid is much more difficult than any before for a Sherpa. I was able to Sherpa people through all the raids in Destiny 1. Being able to rez, or have a man down and not have it be the end of the world was why. For this raid, if you die, and we can't get to you, it's a wipe due to the "Lost Light" timer when someone is down. You can't clutch moments, you have to have a full fireteam for every encounter (aside Bathers you could probably do 5 but not as simply, also not counting counting on environmental flaws like we saw with the 3 and 2 man Calus). It makes it frustrating to deal with people who aren't used to the mechanics because it takes 15 minute encounters hours to complete...each. It's not that we don't want to, it's that taking someone through it who doesn't already mesh with your fireteam well is damn near impossible. My clan has members who have not raided. We will get them through because they mesh well with us from the other content we play together.
