/u/somewittyalias on Is there a need for the development of Strong AI?
I meant it mostly as a joke. I don't think we'll have strong AI during my lifetime. But maybe there is a 5% chance it will happen. And if it did, there would be some exponential growth where the strong AI could make a stronger version of itself and very quickly humans would be useless. There would be no jobs for which it would be cheaper to hire a human.
