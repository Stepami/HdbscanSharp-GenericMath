Data Partition Error when processing in Tab cube
Hello, I've got a tab cube that has data partitions, and today when it makes its weekly run I get the error: 'Process partition error: measure group 'PartitionName' must have at least one partition defined in tabular mode' Everything seems fine in terms of the partition template and partition manager tables, and there is data in the table that it's pulling in from. I've called up the SSIS package that it's running and it validates fine. I'm quite stumped and not sure where else to look. I've even tried running it again from the top, as well and sticking in values to trigger the processing of the 2 data partitions to process this round, and I consistently keep getting the same error.
