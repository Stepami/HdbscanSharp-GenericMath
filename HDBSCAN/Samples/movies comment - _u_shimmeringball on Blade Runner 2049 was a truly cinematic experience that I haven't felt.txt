/u/shimmeringball on Blade Runner 2049 was a truly cinematic experience that I haven't felt in a long time
I think the film was boring at first, entirely slow at the start but after around 30 minutes it picked up. The rest of it was awesome and I wish some things had been done differently, namely I'd have liked his holographic girlfriend to survive, and in some ways she might have because I doubt 1 smash kick from the android woman would've destroyed a microchip so badly it was unrecoverable, especially given their tech. The music was also annoying because whenever it was outside there was the loud chorus of gibberish you could hardly hear anything over, made me feel weird as if it broke the mood.
