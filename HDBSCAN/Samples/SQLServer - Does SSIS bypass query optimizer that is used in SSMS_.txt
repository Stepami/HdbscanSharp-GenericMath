Does SSIS bypass query optimizer that is used in SSMS?
Forgive me if my terminology or understanding is incorrect as I am still a noob. I was in an interview a month ago and even though I've used SSIS in the past, I haven't had a lot of experience with it. My current position as a consultant basically means I primarily work out of SSMS and then ship my code to a DBA to move into a package. In the interview, I relayed to them that I outlined how I work as stated above, at which point the interviewer asked/told me that SSIS doesn't optimize queries like SSMS does. Thinking about this now, it seems suspect and I can't seem to find any info on it by googling.  submitted by /u/TheDeepFryar [link] [comments]
