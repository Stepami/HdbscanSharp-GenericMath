Chrome devtools: How to "freeze" content to inspect element? Especially javascript triggered one. For example: Hovering creates a dropdown menu, how to inspect it? If I move the cursor it's gone.
For example see stripe.com. Hover over the navbar and theres a submenu coming up. However, I cant inspect it, cause it's triggered by hovering, and I need to move the cursor to inspect it. If I turn on :hover on the element, it doesn't work either. I ran into this problem a hundred times now, whats the solution? (I guess it's easy, I just haven't heard of it) edit: I think I wasn't clear, so I try to clear it up: Lets say you have a link, hovering it changes its color and a dropdown menu comes up under it. When you check :hover in devtools, only the color will change, the dropdown doesn't appear cause its a different element  submitted by /u/p_howard [link] [comments]
