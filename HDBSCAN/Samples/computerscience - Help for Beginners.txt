Help for Beginners
I've had a love for computers for as long as I can remember. Computer science has always fascinated me and I'm considering to possibly head down that path in the culture. The only issue is, I don't know where to start. I've tried books, videos and apps, but I can't seem to find a ground level to it all. Where can I start learning the basics of computer science?  submitted by /u/teenbookhoarder [link] [comments]
