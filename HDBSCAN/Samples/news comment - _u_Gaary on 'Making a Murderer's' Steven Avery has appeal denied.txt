/u/Gaary on 'Making a Murderer's' Steven Avery has appeal denied
It's not about what I want to be true, I couldn't care less about either party really. Avery was enough of a fuck up that I'd bet he'd end up back in prison anyway, he was pretty much fucked from his first trip to prison/jail. My point was that it's a leap to say that he did these creepy things to the victim so he might have killed her. That's a pretty steep escalation. But when talking about the cop possibly planting evidence, this isn't just a "the man is out to get me" thing. It's, "he falsely imprisoned me before, the state/federal investigators told him to stay away from the case, and then surprise he's the one out of dozens of other law enforcement to find key evidence."
