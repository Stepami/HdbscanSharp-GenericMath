/u/SexyMrSkeltal on TIL that TBS speeds up shows almost 10 percent to fit more ads into each timeslot
I live on the West Coast, so most TV shows will air about three hours earlier in the East Coast due to the time zone difference. If the show is popular enough to be quickly uploaded, you can easily find it a couple hours before it would actually air here. That's how I watched all of WestWorld, I was too impatient to wait for it to air locally so I watched it online earlier.
