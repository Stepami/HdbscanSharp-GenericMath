/u/thexeleven on Which column to partition?
To be fair, OP posted a super generic question that could be nothing more than a homework assignment or an interview test by someone that doesn't have much of a clue to what they are on about. But I agree with /u/CmdrBigFatBeard that the DateID would be the better choice. If for nothing else but maintainability in regards to partitioning schemes. It's pretty easy to break down DateIDs into specific chunks as they tend to follow a specific pattern and because the Date Dimension is practically the most common dimension when querying fact tables. Many aggregate queries are at various levels of dates, commonly days, months, and years. You could partition on OrderNumber but how do you figure out a scheme? Every 10k? What if that needs to change? Also, how do you predict which OrderNumber will be hit? You can't. It also hints that they are attempting to do per-record look-ups, something an OLAP environment is not necessarily the best at doing and makes me question their overall requirements, design, and implementation.
