Get previous console behavior back?
In Firefox 56 (and earlier), the console has this nice tabular view on the right side when viewing objects: https://i.imgur.com/8VI2lUn.png However in the current Developer Edition, the console seems to have taken a step backward. It just opens objects as a dropdown, similar to Chrome, which I find makes it much harder to scroll through and search object properties: https://i.imgur.com/RscCK0X.png Is there any way to get the old behavior back? üôÅ I've asked on /r/firefox, but thought I'd ask here as well.  submitted by /u/loveofphysics [link] [comments]
