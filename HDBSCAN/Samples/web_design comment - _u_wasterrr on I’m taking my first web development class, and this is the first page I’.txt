/u/wasterrr on I’m taking my first web development class, and this is the first page I’ve made! Any suggestions/tips?
Nice work, great start! Here are some thoughts: Gradient looks nice. The 'Personal' header should probably match up with the link you'd use to get there. Reduce the bottom margin on your subheadings and remove top margin from your paragraphs so that they are closer to the corresponding paragraph. I'd also bump up the font size or decrease the size of your main container. Try to keep each line of body text to around 50-70 characters per line, it will improve readability. And experiment with some other styling options for header links. Try some thing like   a.menu-link { color: #fff; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.05em; text-decoration: none; }
