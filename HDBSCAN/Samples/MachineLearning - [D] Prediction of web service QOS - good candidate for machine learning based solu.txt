[D] Prediction of web service QOS - good candidate for machine learning based solutions?
(Disclaimer - ML newbie here) We have a large scale web service that allows 'publishers' to submit content (hundreds of files totaling dozens of GBs along with some metadata). We then process the files and metadata and prepare them for distribution to 'subscribers'. The end to end workflow can take several hours but varies based on various factors - characteristics of the submission itself, characteristics of our service at that point in time, other submissions that are in queue and potentially various other factors. When the publishers submit their content, they want to know an ETA. This must be a typical problem for such scenarios. Is machine learning a good approach to solve this? If yes, which algorithms are ideal for this. Simply Linear regression or do the latest advancements in ANNs make them better suited for this? Surprisingly (or maybe not), I didn't find many ML research papers on this. Edit - we have significant volume of existing data for this, which could potentially be used for training. I am not sure however if we have kept a record of all the 'relevant' features though. Beyond some obvious ones, i don't even know how to tell what data is relevant to log and use for prediction.  submitted by /u/akb2810 [link] [comments]
