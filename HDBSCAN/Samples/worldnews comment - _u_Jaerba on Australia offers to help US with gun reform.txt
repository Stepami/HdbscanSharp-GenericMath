/u/Jaerba on Australia offers to help US with gun reform
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Let's not repeal laws like this: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-bill-revoking-obama-era-gun-checks-people-mental-n727221  If you want to make this about mental health, then why are Republicans making it more easier for people with mental health issues to buy them? Universal background checks, re: http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/  There's a 90% chance you support them. If you're an NRA member, there's a 74% chance you support them. Why is it so difficult to push legislation going in that direction? Why are any states allowed to have gun laws as lax as Nevada?  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/3/16401880/las-vegas-nevada-gun-law In congruence with that, why are modifications to turn semi-automatic into automatic weapons legal?  https://www.wired.com/story/las-vegas-shooting-automatic-rifle/ Quite frankly, I think pro-gun people have been arguing disingenuously for years. People are quick to point out that automatic rifles are technically illegal but in effect it's perfectly legal to obtain an automatic rifle, provided you modify it yourself. Why are these modifications, as well as silencers, legal?
