/u/sebastianovigna on xorshift128+, xoroshiro128+ and xorshift1024* RNGs fail BigCrush test
The claim, as stated, is entirely false. You can believe to published papers, verifiable science and public code, or to the rant of a crank in his own blog. I mean, it's like climate-change deniers or anti-vax. The fact that the two lowest bits are LFSR is written in the comments of the code. All bits you get from the PRNG of gcc or Python are LSFRs, so claiming that an LFSR is "not random" and "will catch quite a few people off-guard" is ludicrous. All bits of the Mersenne Twister, the WELL family, Xorshift, etc. are LFSR, and will fail enough large binary rank tests (the test was invented just to criticize LFSRs, as Marsaglia at that time was more on (C)MWC—nobody builds large matrices over Z/2Z using the individual bits of a PRNG). For what I see the author manipulated the test by throwing away most of the best bits. If you throw away enough good bits, at some point the influence of the LFSRs will "enter the radar" of BigCrush. It would have been much simpler to use PractRand—since it applies the binary rank test on the lowest bit in isolation, it fails instantly. There's no need to wait for BigCrush. It's pretty clear this person has no idea of what he's doing. I don't fight with cranks. People might not notice the difference.
