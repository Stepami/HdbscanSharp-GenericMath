/u/youngfoon on Overwatch Halloween 2017 - Skin Predictions
First off, you've got some awesome ideas! Here are some of my feedbacks.. D.Va - I really like the idea but as a Korean I think "YaOng" would be the cuter version of a cat-themed name, since GoYangi simply means cat and Yaong! is the Korean version of Meow Genji - Akuma prob similar to his existing Oni skin(would be funny if Hanzo got a skin called Oni-san or Oni-jjan mocking Genji's Oni skin cuz it means "big brother" Doomfist - Doesn't Junkrat already have a clown skin? Orisa - I love the gargoyle concept!!! kinda like Stonehardt right? Mei - not too sure if the queen theme fits her well... they could do something like a reverse-skin between her n snowball Sombra- Zombra, nice one Tracer - this mummy idea is cool but we do have 2 Egyptians!! Widowmaker - I would LOVE to see a skin like "Morrigan Aensland" but in a simpler design spider-webby look Anyways, overall I would totally want these skins! sounds gooooood :D
