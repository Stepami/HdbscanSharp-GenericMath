Using mySQL with node.js/Express
Hi all. I'm having a hard time rendering my mysql query results. The app connects fine to the database, when started and I can do a console.log of the names of my 4 rows. But when I try and parse the same data to a page, nothing happens. My browser seems to be loading (that animated ring) but doesn't load the page. Any advice on what I'm doing wrong? My route is as:  app.get("/", (req, res) => { connection.query("SELECT * FROM Events"), (err, rows) => { if(err) { console.log(err) } else { res.render("index", {events: rows}); } } });  I tried removing the lines on index.ejs that wrote up the query results, but it didn't change anything.  submitted by /u/piitaaraq [link] [comments]
