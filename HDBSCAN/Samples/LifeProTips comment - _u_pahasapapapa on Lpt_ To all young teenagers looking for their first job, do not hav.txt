/u/pahasapapapa on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
Good distinction - I'd never recommend a parent say anything if the teen is present. I was thinking of when one is somewhere without the teen...
