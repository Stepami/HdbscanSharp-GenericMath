I just gave a PAX talk on how to build a mainstream card game. Ask me anything!
This may sound shocking but I built a really fun and balanced game by using index cards and printed out slips of paper. No fancy graphics. Just text on printed cards. Why? I’ve spent my career working at bigger AAA studios like EA, Microsoft, and Starbreeze Studios where digital games spend months to years of development before finding out whether they’re fun. Prototyping on paper is a really critical step in building a great mainstream product and doing it fast! I recently gave a talk: “Next Big Thing: How Games Look and are Prototyped Early In Dev” at PAX West about prototyping with a buddy who worked on Halo 5. My half of the talk was about the nitty gritty behind the prototyping process of Spy Fight—a physical card game I recently designed. The design approach I took used low-cost paper prototypes to get feedback and make the game fun. It was pretty cool because I could write on the cards to address feedback in real-time! Would love to talk about how to make fun games, prototyping and my career in the gaming industry!
