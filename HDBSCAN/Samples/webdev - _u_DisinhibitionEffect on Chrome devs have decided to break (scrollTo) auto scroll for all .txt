/u/DisinhibitionEffect on Chrome devs have decided to break (scrollTo) auto scroll for all websites built prior to Chrome 61
Thanks for stopping by. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that you guys try to keep backwards compatibility a priority while pushing for standardization, and I'm a bit jealous that you all have the resources for such outreach, though with such a massive user-base, I'd expect nothing less. It's a hard line to walk, and I think this was handled well. I just think it's funny that StackOverflow's paradigm makes you paint yourself in a position of not knowing when you just want to share a solution after-the-fact. I've been there myself. It's particularly bothersome if you don't bother pre-writing an answer before submitting the question. Someone always jumps in within the first few minutes with something rules-lawyer-y, or the developer equivalent of #notyourpersonalarmy, or just a half-assed answer. Like GitHub, StackOverflow can make people noticed among the wider developer community, and some folks seek to game the system. Self-answered questions are particularly ripe targets for that behavior.
