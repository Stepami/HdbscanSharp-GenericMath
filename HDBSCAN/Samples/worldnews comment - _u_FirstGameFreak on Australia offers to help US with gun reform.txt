Do you take the 1st Amendment as scripture? Do you consider the right to freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and right to peaceable assembly a right that can be taken away legally through due process? What about the 4th Amendment? The 5th? Or do you consider these rights something that are inalienable human rights, rights that exist even if they don't appear on paper? Because that's what the bill of rights is meant to be, an explicit statement of human rights under a government that can't be taken away even if the government tries to remove them. The way you think about the 1st or 4th or 5th amendment, I feel about the 2nd.
