/u/translucent on Newbie question: Can someone point me to a resource covering all the standard URL-fixing redirects a simple site would need?
Why is there no such thing as 'standard' url-input-leniency redirects? There seems to be a handful of common ways a user might input a URL that would lead to a 404 error, that any site would want to cover themselves against (e.g., leaving off the '.html') It seems like a very obvious, common sense conclusion to me. I'd love if someone could respectfully explain how my thinking is in error.
