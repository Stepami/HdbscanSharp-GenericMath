LPT: If your elderly parents or friends plan on selling or donating old items in their house before a move or garage sale, teach them how to research the value of items online, or help them yourself.
I about cried when I found out my parent found our old working NES and SNES I thought was missing for $20 each with like 30 games each. "No one plays old games anymore" was their logic and they thought they had a good price for them. They also sold for $5 each vintage 90's basketball jerseys in good condition of well known players. All in all they made like $75 on items they could've gotten over $500+. A lot of older people don't understand that some of the stuff they view as junk can have real value. Help them learn to see if it does.  submitted by /u/HoosierProud [link] [comments]
