/u/shiftypoo269 on TIL that after Spartacusâ€™ revolt in 73 BCE, 6,000 slaves were crucified along a 120-mile stretch of road called the Appian Way. This equated to roughly 50 slaves per mile or roughly 1 slave every hundred feet. The mass crucifixion served as a deterrent to anyone else who thought to defy Rome.
Boy, Bobacus who runs the local builder supply company is going to shit himself when he finds out about this.
