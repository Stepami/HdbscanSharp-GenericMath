Just got a new grad offer. During the onsite, one of the recruiters said they will not negotiate the offer. Do I try to negotiate the offer?
They explicitly said "We do not offer negotations for new grads; we calculate what is in the competitive market in this area and the US. Please do not try to negotiate" during the onsite. This is a Big N company. Honestly this sounds odd for a company this size to say. I'm a huge negotiator and have negotiated my pay all of my (young) life. I love the thrill of negotiating, and 90% of the time, it has paid out for me. Should I really just believe them that they won't negotiate? Or should I press it? I have another offer, which I told them about, but it's significantly less than their offer. They don't know that part, though.  submitted by /u/amazonforest [link] [comments]
