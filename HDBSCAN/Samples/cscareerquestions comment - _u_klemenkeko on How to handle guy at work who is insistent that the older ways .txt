/u/klemenkeko on How to handle guy at work who is insistent that the older ways of developing are better than newer version?
He is lazy. Thats it. He doesnt want to learn new technologies. He knows what he knows and he wants to use classic APS. NET WebForms instead of moving to new things like MVC and Entitiy framework. Lazy to write tests, etc. He must hate you too because you are motivated and he is not. You must provide some practical examples like comparation between old/new tech so everybody is 100% with you. You need to face him with the fact that he must learn new stuff every day, every year because thats the business we are into :) Edit: typos
