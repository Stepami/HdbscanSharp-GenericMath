/u/LeonidasSpacemanMD on New NFL QB index has Dak rated at 6, above Matt Ryan and Carr.
I dont get why Belichick is seen as having had this massive affect on Brady's output but Payton doesnt get credit for Brees' Of course Belichick is in another world as a defensive coach, but Payton obviously knows how to design an effective offense. And Brees was much less productive before going to New Orleans I just dont understand this recent trend to make it seem like brady is terry bradshaw all of sudden. The dude puts up MVP numbers year after year, you cant fake that with a good offense
