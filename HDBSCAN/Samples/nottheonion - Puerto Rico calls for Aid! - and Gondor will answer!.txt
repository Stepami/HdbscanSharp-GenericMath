Puerto Rico calls for Aid! - and Gondor will answer!
Hello friends and redditors. As many of you know Puerto Rico is in dire need of help. Their island has been devastated by multiple hurricanes and after all that they are not getting the help they deserve as Americans, or indeed as human beings. Because of this unpresidented situation we are asking you to help if you can. As an island with every port destroyed, material goods are simply not as helpful as direct donations. I have personally donated to Unidos Por Puerto Rico 100% of donations to them will go to their relief effort.  Please see below for other charities and guides on what to do to help if you choose to. How to help Puerto Rico - Consumer Reports How you can help - PBS Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this. If you choose to donate, please post a link to your chosen relief group on your facebook! Let the people of Puerto Rico know that we will not stand by and do nothing!  submitted by /u/max_vette [link] [comments]
