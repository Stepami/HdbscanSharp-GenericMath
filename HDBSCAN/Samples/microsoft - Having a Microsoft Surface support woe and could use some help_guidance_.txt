Having a Microsoft Surface support woe and could use some help/guidance.
Hi there. I purchased a reconditioned Surface Pro 4 in June which works fairly well aside from the adapter. I contacted Microsoft support today to get a warranty placement (as it won't charge sometimes, have to unplug and replug to the wall multiple times to get it to work.) I'm being forced to mail my power adapter in and wait until they receive it to get a replacement. I've offered up my credit card to secure an advanced replacement and have been denied. I attempted to escalate the case and have been denied. The support representative admitted to me that I had the wrong adapter for my product. (this is the adapter I received with my Edit: didn't receive wrong adapter, just less common low wattage one for the m3. While it doesn't work all the time -- I can usually get it to work and continue working with. If it were normal circumstances I'd probably be fine with the wait time -- but I don't feel as though I should be penalized by being unable to use my device when I was apparently sent the improper adapter in the first place. I don't feel as though I am being unreasonable here -- I'm even fine with paying for the adapter and getting a credit upon return of mine. I'm getting stonewalled. I use this device for work -- so I was hoping for a little more customer service. Is there anything that can be done here? Or should I start sourcing an alternate device to use in the meantime. Edit: Contacted Microsoft again and was again told I am out of luck and to see if I can borrow an adapter from a friend or buy one from a local store and return it. I suppose those are my options. Edit2: seems an accessory just shipped. So looks like I CAN wait. Shrug. Problem solved.  submitted by /u/goodsirknyght [link] [comments]
