Looking for the name of one online course
Not too long ago I read a post here about online courses. One suggested andrew Ng's ML course on coursera and his deep learning course. However there's another he or she suggested taking in between the two courses. I forgot the name of the course or the instructor. I know it's vague but can someone remind me what it is?  submitted by /u/chaoism [link] [comments]
