Studying for 70-461, FOR XML PATH makes my soul hurt
I am trying to figure out how to reverse engineer the data from XML PATH queries, but it seems like its much more complicated. FOR XML AUTO and FOR XML AUTO, ELEMENTS and FOR XML RAW all have easy ways to differentiate them. When I looked at the XML PATH query towards the end of my chapter, I had to stare HARD at it just to figure out what was going on. Im having a very hard time visualizing how the subqueries structure the xml. I dont have the code to show, im just venting lol. Ill figure it out after beating my head against the book a few more hours.  submitted by /u/MrSolitaire [link] [comments]
