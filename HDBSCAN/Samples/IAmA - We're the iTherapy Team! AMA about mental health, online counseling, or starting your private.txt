We're the iTherapy Team! AMA about mental health, online counseling, or starting your private practice!
Good morning! I'm Carol Pulley, co-founder of iTherapy. I've brought with me the iTherapy team to answer your questions about mental health, online counseling, and starting a private practice. iTherapy provides a comprehensive suite of tools and services to help mental health professionals start or grow their private practice. For mental health related questions, you may see responses from myself, u/DrAmberLyda, and u/DrJanaScrivani. For private practice questions, I'll respond along with u/WozMarketing, u/MHLynk, and u/kellyconsult. We'll be checking in on this all day. What questions do you have for us? :) My Proof: https://imgur.com/a/4yctL  submitted by /u/iTherapy [link] [comments]
