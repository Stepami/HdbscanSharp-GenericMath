/u/slayer991 on Lpt: To all young teenagers looking for their first job, do not have your parents speak or apply for you. There's a certain respect seeing a kid get a job for themselves.
My son got out of the Navy in April. He had a full-time summer job (which he found on his own)...which he quit when school started in the fall. Now he's looking for a part-time gig while he's in school. I did 2 things for my son. First, I rewrote his resume. Second, I helped him network with some military vets that could provide him with some leads. The rest is on him.
