TIFU: By buying my brother a very powerful PC.
Yesterday was my little brothers birthday, and he's a pretty heavy gamer. He plays games on a shitty laptop and always complains about fps. I decided to buy him a pretty powerful pre-built PC that had a gtx 1080, and a i7 7700k. Top of the line shit. Spent a lot of money on it, but he's my brother and I love him. Turns out the only games he plays is hearthstone and runescape which both can literally be ran on a fuckin iPhone. All this power essentially gone to waste.. Im not even sure if the graphics card turns on when he runs these games... and the only other program he runs is Microsoft word and I doubt thats stressing the i7 7700k... needless to say wasted a lot of money when I could have bought something significantly cheaper for the same performance, and I can't take it back now. TLDR: bought very powerful pc, brother only plays runescape  submitted by /u/helvetica3 [link] [comments]
