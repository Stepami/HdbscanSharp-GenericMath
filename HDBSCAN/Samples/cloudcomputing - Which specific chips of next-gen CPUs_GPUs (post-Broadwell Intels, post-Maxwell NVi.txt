Which specific chips of next-gen CPUs/GPUs (post-Broadwell Intels, post-Maxwell NVidias, AMD Zen-based CPUs/GCN 3rd+ gen architecture GPUs) are offered by the main IaaS players?
I considered about asking this in /r/hardware but concluded that it would be against the rules. Here's what I know for sure: Google Cloud announced NVidia Tesla P100 cards and AMD FirePros S9300s (GCN 3rd gen) back in November, which went into closed beta for GPU Compute instances in February, alongside Skylake-EP Xeons (which became generally available for Compute Engine customers on May 31st). Based on the information given on the company's blog, I guessed it would be something like a Xeon Gold 5117, but it may also be a custom chip designed specifically for Alphabet instead of off the shelf. There's a 6-10% surcharge for these CPUs (waived until July 31st). AWS has no next-gen offerings currently available. They announced EC2 C5 instances back in November that would use some kind of Skylake Xeon, but since then, radio silence. I don't know much about Azure, IBM BlueMix, or Baidu Cloud.  submitted by /u/lambdaexpress [link] [comments]
