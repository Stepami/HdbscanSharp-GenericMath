/u/Cessabits on Bombed my first technical interview and it was a super easy question!
First of all, that's rude of the interviewer.  Ya, actually I can't believe I didn't comment on that. That's incredibly unprofessional and shitty. If the interviewer was also a potential manager I think OP dodged a bullet tbh
