Sombra's hack or EMP should make enemies with low health visible to all allies through walls
Her hack only lasts for 5 seconds so I don't think it would be OP but it would be just enough time to signal allies to turn their attention towards that enemy and take them out. What do you guys think?  submitted by /u/Magikly [link] [comments]
