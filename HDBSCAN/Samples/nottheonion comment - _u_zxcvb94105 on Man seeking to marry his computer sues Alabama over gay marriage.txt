Polygamists cannot consent without violation of torts. Stated another way, I cannot grant a currently defined marital right to more than one other party as the rights, particularly in community property states, are singular to the other party. To the strawman outside this, I agree. Polygamy between genuinely consenting adults could be allowed, but, and as I noted before I'm anti-marriage as a business agreement, it would be far better to allow conveyance of terms between N parties using standard legal constructs. For example, my wife has unique authority under medical care, but I maintain medical power of attorney naming her and others in rank order. Marriage should not require prioritizing her with or without MPoA, but the law treats her as a victim to be cared for and thus, to protect a financial interest, grants her authority should I be unable to exercise my wishes. There are hundreds of examples. Specific to the polygamy strawman, the sad reality is that many of these arrangements are one-sided communal living agreements benefiting the singular man amongst many young (or child) brides. Age or consent and ability to consent would need to be considered. For all marriage there should be a decoupling (pun intended) between religion (if any), money and cohabitation/sex/children. Marriage of the bible is nothing like modern American marriage, and no current definition treats parties as equals to define rights and terms. As separate-but-equal is also a challenge it will take time for humans to evolve, but trends show more opting not to marry and to simply enter into formal or informal agreements.
