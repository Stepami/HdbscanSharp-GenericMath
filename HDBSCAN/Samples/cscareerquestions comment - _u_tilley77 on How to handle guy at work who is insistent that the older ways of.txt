To add to your point most commercial software projects are domintated not by technical objectives but by business objectives. One of the dominant business objectives is solve problems with the least amount of resources in the smallest amount of time. If a problem has already been solved why spend more money and time to solve it again with this year's technical best practise?? The industry is full of legacy systems and code because organizations can't afford the potential downtime a rewrite might introduce. If you really are right about how you want to do it you are going to have to sell it to upper management not on technical merits but business ones. This is usally where junior devs lose their case because the senior ones know what managers want to hear.
