Well...Here's my experience being nonbinary. Gonna try to make it short as possible. Note, these are only MY experiences and I don't speak for the whole community. Every trans person, binary and nonbinary, have different journeys on how they got to the point they are in today. Basically, it just means I'm not a boy or a girl. The gender that I was assigned at birth (sex) is not what I am. I noticed that whenever I'm in a social group of girls or boys, there's this innate feeling that I don't belong in those groups. They socialize in different ways, and I feel like I don't fit in there. It's more than just personality or liking masculine/feminine things. I guess it's just something that one can't explain with words. It's like explaining pain or color to a colorblind alien that never felt pain. It's not that my interactions in girl/boy groups are bad, but I know that I'm not one of them because the gender I was assigned at birth is just not comfortable. I do get some sort of physical dysphoria with my voice, face and body features, and height. My voice and height really gives away that I'm not androgynous as I want be, as I should be. I did try to be the opposite gender, but I still encountered the same issues as the gender I was assigned at birth. After some years of denial, I came to the conclusion that I am nonbinary. In the back of my mind, I knew that if there was a third gender in legal documents, I would definitely take it. I could say more, but this is already too long. Hopefully I was able to get my point across.
