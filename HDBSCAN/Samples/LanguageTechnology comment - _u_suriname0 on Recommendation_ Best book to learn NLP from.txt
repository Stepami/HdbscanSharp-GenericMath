/u/suriname0 on Recommendation: Best book to learn NLP from
Reposting from a recent thread: Prof. Emily Bender answers a similar question in a medium post she wrote: What books or resources would recommend to someone new to computational linguistics? The classics are Jurafsky & Martin’s text book, the NLTK book by Bird et al, and Manning & Schutze’s text book. Also check out the #NLProc tag on twitter. For someone coming from CS only, I also recommend my book: Bender, Emily M. 2013. Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax. Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies #20. Morgan & Claypool Publishers.
