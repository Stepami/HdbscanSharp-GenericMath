/u/Khaaannnnn on San Juan Mayor: Trump’s Remarks Were ‘Insulting,’ ‘Minimized Our Suffering’

"But the other thing that's also true is that the administration has answered and has complied with our petitions in an expedited manner."  ... Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN on Saturday that recovery efforts hinge on good communication and coordinated efforts. "The bottom line is we've had a joint field office established for numerous days in San Juan and what we need is for the good mayor to make her way to the joint field office and get plugged into what's going on," he said when asked about the President's tweets about Yulín Cruz.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/30/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-recovery/index.html
