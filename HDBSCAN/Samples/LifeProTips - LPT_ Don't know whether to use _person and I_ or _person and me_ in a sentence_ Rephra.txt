LPT: Don't know whether to use "person and I" or "person and me" in a sentence? Rephrase the sentence as if it only talked about you and you'll have the correct answer.
Using "X and I" or "X and me" incorrectly is a huge pet peeve of mine, but luckily there is a quick fix! In nearly every case, you can drop the "X" in the sentence and re-state your sentence to figure out whether "me" or "I" is appropriate.   Incorrect: Make sure you send the email to John and I. Solution: Make sure you send the email to me. Correct: Make sure you send the email to John and me.  Incorrect: Me and Kate went to the store.  Solution: I went to the store.  Correct: Kate and I went to the store.  Incorrect: Did you see the picture of Chris and I?  Solution: Did you see the picture of me?  Correct: Did you see the picture of Chris and me?  Incorrect: Me and Sara are going to Vegas.  Solution: I (am) going to Vegas.  Correct: Sara and I are going to Vegas.     post was deleted earlier so I adjusted title. hope this conforms to LPT rules now...  submitted by /u/throwaypolitics [link] [comments]
