TripAdvisor tech reputation for internship?
Just started interviewing with them for an internship and I'm waiting to hear back on next steps. I'm curious what kind of weight TripAdvisor might bring to a resume, they seem like a really cool & modern company doing some really interesting things. It would be quite a relocation from where I currently am, and I wouldn't know really anyone in the area. This isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but I'm just curious as to the general sentiment about TripAdvisor in the tech field and if it would be worth a move like this to have this experience. Thanks!  submitted by /u/ICED_TEA_PIONEER [link] [comments]
