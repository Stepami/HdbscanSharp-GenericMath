[D]Looking for a medium difficulty ML project...
I am looking for a semester long project in ML with a group size of 2-4 people preferably with Neural Networks. We looked into gaming (flappy bird) but turns out the scope is pretty small for a final year under-grad project. We also looked at self playing Mario. Could you please tell me whether the scope of Mario is good enough for this project. Also, please suggest other project ideas in ML.  submitted by /u/Fe_man_ [link] [comments]
