Advice on upgrading 2012 to 2016 Reporting Services
Hi folks, I've been debating asking this for a while. I look after a core Reporting Services box in our enterprise running Sql 2012. I have built a new box with 2016 but not certain on migrating the 2012 instance to the new server. Right now that new RS instance is just the vanilla install. As we are happening to review our DR process I actually restored the 2012 server to a stand alone box then tried the Sql 2016 upgrade thinking it would upgrade the instance then I could backup and restore that to the 2016 box. It didn't seem to be upgradable so I'm not certain on the best pathway forward. Can I restore a 2012 RS db to a 2016 instance and expect that to work? Or do I have to get tricky and script inserts into the Catalog table etc. I could look at the Visual Studio mass deployment however there's a stack of reports and too many linked reports for that to be viable. Not to mention all the existing subscriptions that need setting up. I did a similar thing with 2005 to 2012 a few years ago however we did this manually and report by report, proc by proc. Largely because Dundas was integrated into the new version and the rdls required manual updates. Does anyone have any advice?  submitted by /u/colabus [link] [comments]
