TIFU by ignoring a small patch of poison ivy and ended up contaminating all of my nether regions
Sorry about my English, it's my first language. A couple weeks ago I noticed a small round bump on my right knee was really itching. I thought it was a bug bite and decided to ignore it. Kept itching. Couple days later I noticed the spot had grown, and I started to think I might have actually gotten poison ivy somehow. Still not sure really...probably when I was dicking around with the hose spicket in my back yard. Anyways I kept ignoring the itching the best I could. I was going to tough it out and not spend $30 bucks on the cream that supposedly removes the oil. It would pass soon, right? Another week goes by. Knee still itches. Then my other knee starts to itch. God damnit. Now I have a full on rash on my right knee and a new one developing on my left knee. I think I transferred the oil to a pillow I put between my knees one night. Or I just transferred the oil with my hand. No clue. Tried to ignore the itch on knee #2 now too. A week later I notice my man parts are starting to itch pretty often. Annoyingly often. Then A LOT. Then I realized I had successfully contaminated the base of my penis with poison ivy oil. Or I had contracted herpes. Probably happened when I was taking a piss or researching stuff on the internet. Another week goes by. Finally break down and buy the cheap poison ivy wash. Provides short term relief but the itching returns. Miserable. Waking up at night to apply Benadryl to my knees, my dick, and neck, a spot under my beard. God my ass has been itching a lot lately.. TL;DR: There is no ignoring poison ivy, only misery. You'll end up inadvertently contaminating all of your nether-regions, ass included. Broke down and bought the expensive creams. Finally on the mend, I hope.  submitted by /u/FRESH_OUTTA_800AD [link] [comments]
