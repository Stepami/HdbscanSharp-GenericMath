I mean, I personally know people who have had the experience where their parents were told not to teach their kids ASL for various reasons when a CI was involved. More recently, I've also interpreted at audiologist appointments where the parents were told to sign less with their kids. I've also known people who were going into audiology specifically to be one of those doctors that DOESN'T do that because it was such a well-known phenomenon or they knew people who had that experience. I suppose my statement came across as too broad as to seem like it meant ALL experiences with audiologists are like that, which certainly wasn't my intent, but my point still stands that it has and does happen. And the point about Gallaudet is 100% true, I witnessed it firsthand as a student at the school and know people who still live in the area/go to school there who have verified that it's still present. I have no doubt about the ability to express oneself in English leading to a decreased desire to sign in both CI and hearing babies. That's perfectly reasonable and up to the parent to decide what to do from there.
