I really don't understand how a bug in a static class is different than a bug anywhere else, except for the mechanics of what you're describing. It's not as if static classes are the only thing with state, or the only thing that can be carelessly altered. To your final point, such a changeset is problematic; your example perfectly describes why small commits are desired, and why critical changes should not occur so soon before release. This is a process issue, not a code issue.
