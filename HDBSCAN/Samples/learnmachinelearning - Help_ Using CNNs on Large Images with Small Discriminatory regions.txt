Help: Using CNNs on Large Images with Small Discriminatory regions
Thanks for your attention. I'm doing a CNN project where I have a set of tissue sample images and a simple Boolean for each image, cancerous or not. Most of each image is presumably non-discriminatory. My goal is to produce a net that can identify bounding boxes around key cancerous features in each image. Currently my model does something like this:  Input (512, 512, 3) 3x3 Conv (510, 510, 128) 3x3 MaxPool (170, 170, 128) ... 3x3 Conv (32, 32, 128) 1x1 Conv (32, 32, 32) 1x1 Conv (32, 32, 1) Dropout Global Max Pool  I feel as though I'm missing something with this method. My major goal is to accurately identify regions of interest, not maximize accuracy. Any alternative approaches to this problem would also be appreciated.  submitted by /u/vannak139 [link] [comments]
