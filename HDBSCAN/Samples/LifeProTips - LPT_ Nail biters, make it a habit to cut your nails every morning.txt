LPT: Nail biters, make it a habit to cut your nails every morning
Carefully cut off all loose and potentially tempting parts, it will make your nails look a lot better and also make it less convenient to start biting your nails. I've been a nail biter all my life and it's a bad habit I won't get rid off, but since I'm doing this my nails are so much prettier and my temptation to bite nails is a lot less.  submitted by /u/heart4hard [link] [comments]
