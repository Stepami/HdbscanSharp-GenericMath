I applied last year for an internship and got rejected. 3.5, average state school. So I applied this year for full-time after having an internship and have a phone screen. If there's one thing I've been finding out is that having a good internship can more than make up for GPA and school, so I really wouldn't stress about that part. Getting that first internship is a pain in the ass though.
