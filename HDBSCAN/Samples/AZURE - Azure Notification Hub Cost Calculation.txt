Azure Notification Hub Cost Calculation
I have 250+ apps for which I want to send push notifications. Also, I want the rich telemetry for each app. As per my understanding, to achieve this, I need to create 3 standard tier namespaces. In each namespace I can create 100 Notification Hubs for 100 Apps i.e. 3 namespaces - 3 x 100 = 300 notifications hubs to support 300 apps. Base charges per Standard Namespace costs $200/month. In our case, we have to support 250+ apps and need to create 3 standard namespaces so the total cost will become 3 x $200 = $600/month (Base cost). Is there any other way to support 250+ apps and costs less than $600/month?  submitted by /u/siwachbit [link] [comments]
