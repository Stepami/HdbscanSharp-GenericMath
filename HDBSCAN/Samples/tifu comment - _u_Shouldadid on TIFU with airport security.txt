/u/Shouldadid on TIFU with airport security
I honestly can never tell if they are being serious. My last experience went like this: 'that's an interesting t-shirt, what's on the front?' 'um, a bands logo' 'but what plant is that in the logo?' 'oh the thing around the outside? I'm not great at plants, um, a palm tree? It's a palm tree' 'its not a palm tree, I have a palm tree in my house & it doesn't look like that' 'wow, you must have a big house to have a palm tree in it' 'I meant in the garden' 'oh okay' 'its a marijuana leaf isn't it?' 'maybe, like I said, not good with plants' 'you're traveling here from the UK?' 'yes' 'is marijuana legal there?' 'no, but t-shirts are' 'okay have a nice day'.
