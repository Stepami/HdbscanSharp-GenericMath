/u/naynaythewonderhorse on Disney CEO Bob Iger says heâ€™s stepping down in 2019, and this time he means it
In general, he likes bringing inanimate objects to life. Lamps, toys, cars, unicycles, and more. In fact, before Toy Story became the first CGI film, he pitched The Brave Little Toaster as having that honor. He also has a short film from before he joined Pixar that features another inanimate lamp coming to life.
