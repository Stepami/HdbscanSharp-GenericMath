No good title but need help
I'm building a public transit prediction app using the Boston MBTA RealTime API. The API offers a route to get all the stops that are near a lat/long coordinate. This makes it easy to get all the stops that are within a short distance to the user. However, the JSON returned doesn't specify which routes serve that stop. To see which routes serve a stop, you have to make a separate call to the API specifying the stop ID. So to illustrate the problem, where I live there are essentially 4 routes that serve the area, 71 bus inbound and outbound and 73 bus inbound and outbound. A call to the API returns 15 stops. The first 8 stops are for the 73 going in one direction or another and the second 7 are for the 71. It's not useful to know predictions for stops on the same route going the same direction. Ideally I'd be able to show the closest stop for each route. But I don't want to make 15 requests. I'm still pretty new to web development, so there may be an obvious solution. Right now I have narrowed it down to two possibilities: 1) load the entire list of MBTA stops into the app when it first loads. Then when I get the stop information I'll have list to filter duplicates against. I can get this information from the API, as they have a route for all stops. 2) is there a way to chain requests to a server so that I can get information for all 15 stops with one request? Thanks for reading and any input is helpful.  submitted by /u/vinsneezel [link] [comments]
