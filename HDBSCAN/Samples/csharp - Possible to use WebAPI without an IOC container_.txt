Possible to use WebAPI without an IOC container?
I cannot find any information on this, which leads me to believe its either not possible, or not a good idea. But I'll ask anyway: Is it possible to use Web API without using an IOC container like Unity (or any other one)? For example in an extremely simple project, what if we don't want to bother with the complexity of a container? Is it even possible to not use a container? How will my API controllers get called? Will they have to be parameter-less? What are the other considerations?  submitted by /u/beer0clock [link] [comments]
