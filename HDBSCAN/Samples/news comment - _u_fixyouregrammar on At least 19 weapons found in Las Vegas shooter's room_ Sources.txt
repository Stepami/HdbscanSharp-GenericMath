No I agree with you - I’m sorry I misunderstood. I want there to be less guns. I want there to be less ammo and limited capacity. I want so much about this situation to change. I’m from the north east - that part of America that is as European as you get, and has a very small gun culture. I didn’t grow up with guns, and have zero obsession with them. I just am frustrated defending my country, were flawed like everyone, but we are filled with great people and have done great things as a nation. I still believe in my home. We also have a rabid gun base (40%), and the tallest task of any country in the world when it comes to controlling this problem. I hope we can create legislation that will help dramatically reduce the ability for these disasters to occur. I just don’t know how you beat this group of people who refuse to make any adjustments.
