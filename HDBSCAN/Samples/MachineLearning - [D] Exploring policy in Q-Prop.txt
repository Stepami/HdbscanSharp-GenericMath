[D] Exploring policy in Q-Prop
Hi everyone, I've recently read the paper for the Q-Prop by S.Gu (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02247) and I've a question about the Critic update. For a quick summary, the idea here is to combine Stochastic Policy Gradient (like in TRPO) and Deterministic Policy Gradient (like in DDPG) to update our policy. In the paper, the algorithm do not use a policy exploration like in DDPG (an off-policy), it is only on policy with the stochastic policy doing the exploration. But the critic is updated like in the DDPG paper, with a exploration policy noted β, which is defined no where in their experiments. Therefore, I'd like to understand what do we need to choose as β. Should we use the on-policy (stochastic policy)? Or a normal noise applied on the deterministic policy? Or else? Thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/amathlog [link] [comments]
