I'm Gabriel Wyner, author of Fluent Forever. I'm also running a Kickstarter for a language learning tool that's become the most funded app of all time. AMA!
Hi Reddit! My name is Gabriel Wyner. I'm a former opera singer with a mechanical engineering background, and in 2014, I wrote the book Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language and Never Forget It, where I look into the science of memory to find ways to reach fluency in foreign languages faster. 2 weeks ago, I launched a Kickstarter for a language learning tool that's become the most funded app of all time. AMA about languages, memory, opera singing, living in Europe, dog training, treadmill desks, whatever. I'll answer juuust about anything. Edit: This was awesome! Thanks so much everyone! If you have more questions, keep dropping them here and I'll answer stuff as it comes in.
