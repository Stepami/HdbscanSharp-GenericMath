As a recent graduate who got a job a few months later than I expected
Stop reading this subreddit and trying to figure out the perfect way to get your dream job. Your code will always be more impressive than your grades. If you build something worth talking about and that you can speak to your design decisions you will be much better off than if you are great at leet code. Make a program using an api. Make a crud app Make at least one program that someone can run and see. Make something you are excited about. And pay attention in data structures.  submitted by /u/gtplesko [link] [comments]
