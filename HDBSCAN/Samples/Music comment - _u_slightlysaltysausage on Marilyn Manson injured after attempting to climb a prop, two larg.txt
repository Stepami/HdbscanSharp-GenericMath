/u/slightlysaltysausage on Marilyn Manson injured after attempting to climb a prop, two large guns held together with metal scaffolding, while performing "Sweet Dreams" in New York. He lay on stage limp and covered by a sheet before being carried out on a stretcher and taken to hospital. His condition is not currently known.
Is this not also poor planning?
