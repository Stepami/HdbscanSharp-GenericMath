[AMA Request] Any US Navy top gun pilot from the time around/shortly after Top Gun came out
My 5 Questions: Did the movie change how you felt about your job? Did you experience any significant amounts of notoriety because of the movie? Did the increase in enlistment noticeably change any things for you? How accurately would you say the movie represented being a Top Gun pilot? What was your tensest moment in the air?
