Commercial use of open source libraries.
This is slightly tangential to computer vision but here goes - I want to inculcate a certain solved computer vision functionality for a startup app and for that, on top of OpenCV, I also use some open source code provided under Apache 2.0 license, and GNU v2.0 license. As the app has to be used for commercial purposes, I was wondering the following - 1. Is this legally okay, especially regarding GNU v2.0 (I tried reading the documentation and it seems legal, but the language is somewhat dense, so I just want to be sure) 2. If the answer to above is yes, do I have to make all my code public? I remember reading something like that in the document and I am not allowed to do that as the code then loses its commercial value.  submitted by /u/ArtlockScofield [link] [comments]
