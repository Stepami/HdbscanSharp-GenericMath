Help with ListBox and table entry removal
So I have a very simple table with two columns (ID and Name). ID is a primary key which is made to auto increment when I add new entries. Since the data is small I wanted to make a ListBox from where a user can select an existing entry and delete it. private void buttonRemove_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { con.Open(); SqlCommand cmd = con.CreateCommand(); cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text; cmd.CommandText = (here I'm not sure anymore how to form a correct sql statement which will delete a selected entry).;   cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); con.Close(); }  Help is very much appreciated!  submitted by /u/Pipic12 [link] [comments]
