/u/nerd4code on Apple gave Uber's app 'unprecedented' access to a secret backdoor that can record iPhone screens
Apps accessing you camera are one thing, but the OS itself always has access (and could potentially overwrite firmware, depending on how tied-down all that is), so any exploit that allows access to/via the kernel could make use of the camera somewhat directly and potentially without regard to power status other than battery-removed-off. Only limitation would normally be the differences in hardware/firmware, but Apple doesnâ€™t have that going for it.
