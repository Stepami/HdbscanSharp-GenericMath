/u/lawdknowsit on How much do you charge for monthly website management?
We charge 500kr (about $60) per month in Norway and half that in the UK (different market). That’s for hosting + SSL and form handling. It seems small but AWS hosting fees with static sites meaning that most clients don’t put a dent in overheads. Essentially we have a decent passive income coming in with little to no work needed and more cash if there is work required. We retain client by being very fast and reliable. Your price to most clients really becomes meaningless if you’re personally an asset to their business.
