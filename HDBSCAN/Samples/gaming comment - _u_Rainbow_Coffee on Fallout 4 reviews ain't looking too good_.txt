/u/Rainbow_Coffee on Fallout 4 reviews ain't looking too good.
This thought process can be dangerous if it leads to developers skimping on games and expecting the modding community to pick up the slack. Previously, the developers likely wouldn’t have found this feasible because modders were doing it for fun. Hanging a business plan on a passionate community wouldn’t be a good risk to take. However, now that modders get paid for it, I’m guessing the developers are more likely to try that risk out. They’ll be hoping these passionate modders go all out to fill in the blanks in lackluster games for that little bit of cash. It is a disruptive tactic that could save the developers millions on development costs. If it doesn’t work out, they get trashed for a couple of games and go back to the previous model or try something else new. I hope I’m wrong, but lazy development to maximize profits seems to be the sad, trending direction of the gaming industry at the moment.
