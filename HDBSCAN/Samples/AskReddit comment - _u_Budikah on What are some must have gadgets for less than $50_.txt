/u/Budikah on What are some must have gadgets for less than $50?
I feel ya man... I wanted so badly to play an instrument in band growing up but we just couldn't afford to rent one or buy one at all. I then had the same experience with the Boy Scouts... I ended up just doing the field portion of track and field - I threw heavy things that were provided to me. It was cheap.
