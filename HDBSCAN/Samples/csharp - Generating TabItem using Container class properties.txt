Generating TabItem using Container class properties
Hey there! So basically I have and will have many more classes which are contained by one main class(which they are associated with) in List's. I don't want to manually code that many different looks of ListView and TabItem. So I started thinking how to achieve something smarter.. I managed to loop through container class properties, identify what Type that property is.. But I cannot move forward, because I just don't have any knowledge or ideas what to do with all I got.. I tried to describe what I want to achieve and foundation I suppose to do. But if there is any better way or something I should do in different way, please tell me. Everything will be taken into consideration and any advice's will be taken! thank you very much for reading and any kind of help. Album of code   submitted by /u/xfusion97 [link] [comments]
