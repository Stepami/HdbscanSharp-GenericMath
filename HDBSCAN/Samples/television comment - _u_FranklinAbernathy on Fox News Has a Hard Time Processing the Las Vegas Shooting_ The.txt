/u/FranklinAbernathy on Fox News Has a Hard Time Processing the Las Vegas Shooting: The Daily Show
Also, it's unfortunate, in light of the recent event in Las Vegas, that you've chosen to ignore mass shootings and instead focused only on total gun violence.  Umm, but you cited the decline in gun violence in Australia because of the gun buyback. So I showed you that gun violence in America is declining while gun ownership is increasing. You made the argument not me. I also linked statistics that show that America isn't even in the top 5 for mass shootings. Nations with very strict gun laws like Norway, Finland, Slovakia, and Sweden are all ahead of us for mass murders done by guns. I don't know if you didn't actually read my comment or links or if you can't understand them? Please let me know because I'd love to help you understand such a complicated issue.
