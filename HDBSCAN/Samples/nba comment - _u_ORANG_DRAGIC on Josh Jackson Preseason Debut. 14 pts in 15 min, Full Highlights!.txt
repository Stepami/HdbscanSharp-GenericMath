/u/ORANG_DRAGIC on Josh Jackson Preseason Debut. 14 pts in 15 min, Full Highlights!
i would say he's already one of our best defenders, but played most of his time against the Portland starting lineup which is clearly superior to our team. I would have like to see him more against Portland's rookies and bench, but for whatever reason he didn't play at all in the 4th.
