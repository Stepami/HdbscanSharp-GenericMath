LPT: Put a wet sponge in a zip lock, then in the freezer for a DIY ice pack
Like I said, if you've ever found yourself in need of an ice pack, with a flat cold surface instead of using ice cubes, you can do so with the following steps: Get a sponge, wash it throughly (to prevent mould inside the ziplock) Soak in some water Pop it in a ziplock Place in the freezer for 20mins or so  You now have an ice pack, and if you seal it right, a mess-free ice pack for when it melts.  submitted by /u/Stroopwafeled [link] [comments]
