[Everything] A great spin off, in theory.
I know that basically everything has been discussed already so I apologize if I am repeating someone here but I was just thinking of a great spin off that I would personally be into. For me the most heart breaking moment of the entire series has still been when the Mountain crushed Oberyn in that trial by combat. It just upsets me on so many levels because Oberyn was easily one of my top 3 favourite characters. I would love to see more of his life in action. I think it would be really sweet to see more of his youth. When he would travel and be the cocky jerk that he was, picking on bigger stronger men all the time. Anyway, I dont think this would make a great spinoff for the general public, mainly just for me. But I love the idea of experiencing more Oberyn in all his glory.
