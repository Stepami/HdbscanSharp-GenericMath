/u/Tellsyouajoke on What is the worst line of Dialogue in the history of cinema?
Sorta half a joke, but i’ve heard the theory that explains why she falls for him almost out of nowhere. They meet once for a week or so when he’s 9, and he is very open about his crush for her. Ten years pass until they see again, and she’s the only girl he can think about that entire time. She doesn’t have the same feelings reciprocated until they go on a week long ‘retreat’ that ends with her in love with him? People say that Anakin, having the most raw power in the Force of anyone in the Order, was unknowingly using the Force to pull a mind trick onto her believing she loved him back. Probably not true and just a fan theory, but gives a little deeper meaning to their cringy honeymoon on Naboo
