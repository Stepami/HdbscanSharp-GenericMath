An anecdote from today's guitar session
Here's the story. I was strumming around my mildly restored 10 year old no-name Indonesian acoustic guitar to the chords of "Like a Stone" by Chris Cornell (live version) and whilst I was playing the verse part, I started to subconsciously sang lyrics from "Zephyr Song" by RHCP and it clicked to me that the chords and lyrics fit to a perfect T. I got a little giddy and started to experiment by alternating between lyrics from "Zephyr Song" in one verse to "Like a Stone" in the next verse as well as switching between the two choruses after each verse. Had a great time with that mashup of sorts and I am planning to try it with other songs too :-) . Have some interesting little stories from music sessions, especially with combining and experimentation of songs/instruments, or just songs that go together all too well that might not be known by many? Feel free to share.  submitted by /u/Phyterpilot [link] [comments]
