/u/lonemonk on Marijuana minimum age to be 18 in Alberta
I recently participated in a survey that BC is running on the same topic. Most of the questions were reasonable, but there were a few that forced participants down a Yes, No, Don't Know path when it was not quite a yes/no type question. Overall it was worded ok though. My biggest thing with the Governments now getting involved in this is, that if they don't get a good grasp on this now, people will just do whatever the hell they have been doing up to this point. If their taxation is so strong that it doubles the price of weed? Guess what, no one will use it. No outdoor growing? How about Fuck YOU! I have always supported the legalization of the stuff, but you know how Governments roll. They love to fuck shit up with a bureaucracy that has no idea what its doing.
