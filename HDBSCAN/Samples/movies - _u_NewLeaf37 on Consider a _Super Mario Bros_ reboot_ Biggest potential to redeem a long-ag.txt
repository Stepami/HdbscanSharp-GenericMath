/u/NewLeaf37 on Consider a "Super Mario Bros" reboot: Biggest potential to redeem a long-ago disaster.
I don't think taking away the fantasy element is the best way to adapt the game. I've seen a lot of proposals like this, most of them turning the fantastic parts into Mario's mushroom-induced hallucinations, but these approaches seem even further away from the spirit of the games than the movie we already have. For my money, if anyone were to attempt an adaptation again, the Mushroom Kingdom needs to be no-holds-barred, no-qualifications real. It needs to be Mario and Luigi actually going to another world. Their lives in Brooklyn should be much more hum-drum or even depressing so that when they get to go to an amazing world where they can be heroes, we'd understand why it appeals to them. My own mock-up of an idea sees the brothers as Italian immigrants trying to scratch out a living as plumbers, a profession which neither of them really enjoys but which they have to do. I'm also interested in implying that Mario was drafted into the Vietnam War (a reference to Mario's Bombs Away), though I'm not 100% sure how plausible it would be for a recent immigrant to be drafted. Since there's so little narrative in the first game, it seems most natural to me to have an abnormally long first act and a relatively short second act. Basically, spend a lot of time introducing the brothers and the world they currently know before thrusting them into the unknown where the story becomes pretty simple.
