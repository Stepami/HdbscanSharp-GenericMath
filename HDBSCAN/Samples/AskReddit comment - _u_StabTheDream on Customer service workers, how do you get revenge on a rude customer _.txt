/u/StabTheDream on Customer service workers, how do you get revenge on a rude customer ?
Working as a server in a restaurant, we unexpectedly got busy and we weren't staffed for it so food was taking 20-30 minutes to come out. Most people were cool with it except this one bitch. She asks me what's taking so long and as I try to explain she cuts me off. Asks me something else, and again, cuts me off as I try to answer. This happens a few more times until she asks me something else and I just stand there and not say anything. She asks why I'm not answering and I say, "You never give me a chance to respond so I don't see the point in trying." She just gives me a look and doesn't say anything. Their food comes up shortly after all this and their stay goes on without any further incident. They leave and as expected stiff me, but the bitch left her phone. Decided to give her until the end of my shift to come back for it otherwise I wouldn't be turning it into the office. She didn't come back, so I took it. I know it was petty as hell, but fuck that bitch.
