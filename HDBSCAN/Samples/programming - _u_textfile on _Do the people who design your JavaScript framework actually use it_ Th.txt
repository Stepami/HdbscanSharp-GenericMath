/u/textfile on "Do the people who design your JavaScript framework actually use it? The answer for Angular 1 and 2 is no. This is really important."
Full disclosure, I don't have any position on the politics involved, and I don't develop using any of these frameworks. I'm trying to educate myself about them, which is why I'm bothering to watch a year-old video. This particular argument was aggressive, so I watched other developers that said similar things. My FUD detector's on and I'm trying to listen. But here, I don't think a hammer is the best analogy. It's a language and a logic, and choosing to speak in it and committing your $time to it creates an inherent dependency relationship. And I think he was really trying to express some frustration with an imbalance in that relationship of some kind. Anyway a better analogy might be a language. I want the person writing my language to depend on it as much as I do.
