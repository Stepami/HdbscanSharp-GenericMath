/u/Mr_Manchuck on [Everything] My Fighter Tier list. Input appreciated.
I would move many around but the one I want to focus on is Ned, I think he deserves better treatment here. I know it looked like the end for him at the end of his fight with Arthur Dayne but he held his own against the legendary sword of the morning, 2 swords against 1 for a good while. He also for all we know could have possibly beaten Jaimie in their fight in season 1 but we'll never know how that would have gone now, either way he easily matched another legendary swordsman. He was physically strong and showed himself to be technically abled in sword fighting. He helped Robert carve paths through Westeros not just with his great leadership and wartime strategy but he also had to survive many battles along the way.
