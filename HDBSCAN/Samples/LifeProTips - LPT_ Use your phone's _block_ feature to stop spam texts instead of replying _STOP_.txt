LPT: Use your phone's "block" feature to stop spam texts instead of replying "STOP".
Replying to texts confirms your number as active, and can be sold on spam lists in the future. If you instead just use the "block" feature on your phone, the spammers will continue to waste money texting you, and after years your number will eventually be deemed dead.  submitted by /u/Arconyx [link] [comments]
