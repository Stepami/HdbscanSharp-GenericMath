/u/amanko13 on TIFU with airport security
Well, again... I don't know about American security. Not sure if the arse thing is true anymore. I don't why they would do that or what benefit that could serve. Perhaps American security is concerned with drugs maybe...? Also, not sure what the process is for random screenings at American airports, but at Heathrow, the metal detector detects when someone walks through it and decides if they should be randomly selected for search. So no human judgement involved whatsoever. It's just a quick process of being body scanned and shoes can stay on, they just need to be swabbed to detect for explosive trace.
