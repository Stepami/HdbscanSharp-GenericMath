/u/cloudignitiondotnet on Looking for an Azure master of sorts
I am an MCSE Cloud & Infrastructure as well as MSCD Azure Solutions Architect. I don't work directly for Microsoft, so we are out there (but not many of us). Can you shoot me a PM for what you are looking for? (direct hire, work with an MSP/partner, etc).
