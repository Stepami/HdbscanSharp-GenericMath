Question: Cluster conversational text based on topics
Hi guys, how would one go about clustering conversational text by topic? The text is unlabeled but some have named entites. I've tried an average weighted TF-IDF with w2v and got ok results. My next step would be to try Doc2Vec. For now I've ignored the entities, didn't do anything special with them. But I have one problem with it, let's say I have a long group chat and last week we've talked about the birthday of Tim and today we're talking about the birthday of Mike. With Doc2Vec and my TF-IDF approach I would put these two topics in the same cluster. Is there a way to separate my previous example? I was thinking about including a time factor, but I'm not sure this would be a good approach and how to go about it.  submitted by /u/cs_on_detours [link] [comments]
