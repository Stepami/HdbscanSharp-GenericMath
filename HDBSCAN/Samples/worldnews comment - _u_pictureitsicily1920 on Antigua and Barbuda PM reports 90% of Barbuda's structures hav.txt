/u/pictureitsicily1920 on Antigua and Barbuda PM reports 90% of Barbuda's structures have been "Totally Demolished"
This, Houston, everything else is so horrific. There is honestly nothing that can be said that can alleviate what these people have gone through. I just pray for some kind of relief and peace and serenity and swift recovery for them and everyone else affected. And pray this will not affect anyone else and this shit Irma will dip course away from any more destruction.
