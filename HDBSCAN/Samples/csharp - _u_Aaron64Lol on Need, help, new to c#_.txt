Put together an XML file to contain your prices. Put that XML file on a web server you have access to. Somewhere the URL will not change. Have your mobile app load and process that XML file on request to get your prices by state. You can load and process the whole thing, there is so little data that it shouldn't be a problem. That way you can change the prices whenever you like and the phone apps will update. You don't have enough data for a database to make sense for your needs. You should be safe to encode the states into your application. Give them all a number that matches the number you use for your state information in the XML file. It's a nice simple solution.
