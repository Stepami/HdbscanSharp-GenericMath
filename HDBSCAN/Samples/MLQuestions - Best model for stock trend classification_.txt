Best model for stock trend classification?
I'm working on a project that involves classifying stock trends as either up, down, or sideways, but I wasn't sure what the best model to use might be. I'm thinking this might be a good deep learning problem, maybe even a CNN problem (since the the surrounding data is related, and what makes the "trend"). I was thinking about using tensorflow to tackle the problem, with the input being 126 normalized data points representing stock prices over a 6 month window, and the output a 3 dimensional vector, with each dimension corresponding to a trend (for example, the labels for uptrend, sideways, and downtrend are, respectively, [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1]). What do you guys think the best model for this would be?  submitted by /u/BoredDanMan [link] [comments]
