[Skin Concept] Star Tyrant Syndra
Link Splash Art Short Lore  Hey, lolreddit! I'm back with something a little different this time; some concept work done for a project I worked on together with my awesome friends of Rift Artisans. You might also remember the fanmade Demon Teemo project we worked on! This project is a skin concept for Syndra, turning her into a Star Guardian gone rogue. It has been under work for almost a year now! I had the fun chance to work on both the concept art and the splash for this project. We started work on this before the official Star Guardian Syndra was announced so the leaks set us on quite the emotional rollercoaster. Our version is a bit darker than the official one, as her backstory mirrors base Syndra's somewhat. Unfortunately due to personal circumstances the team wasn't able to put together a video like the last time, but we're going to be posting them individually, so look forward to them uploading their work! Anyway, this was a lot of fun to work on, and I learned a lot! Thanks for looking and as always, feel free to drop any critique in the comments, always appreciate it when you do that.  submitted by /u/VladBacescu [link] [comments]
