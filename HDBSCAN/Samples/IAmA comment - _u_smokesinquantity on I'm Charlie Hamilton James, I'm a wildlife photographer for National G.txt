/u/smokesinquantity on I'm Charlie Hamilton James, I'm a wildlife photographer for National Geographic Magazine. Huge fan of vultures and sea otters. Today is World Animal Day so AMA!
Hey Charlie! I'm a recent graduate in environmental studies and I just landed a job as a wetland scientist in the Midwest. I love plants and I wish everyone shared my joy of conservation like you do. Currently the best way for me to reach out to friends, family and the general public is though social media platforms, specifically Instagram since it is photo and now video based. I love taking plant pictures and sharing information about them with everyone I can in the hopes that someone will click and I can help them find something they love, be it plants, nature in general, or something related to what I do for work. I think it would be an incredible job to travel the world documenting endangered and rare plants. What do you recommend for someone looking to connect with a publishing group like Nat Geo instead of just freelancing? Any good tips for shooting the best pictures outside? Especially at floppy inanimate objects like plants? Also shameless plug in the hopes that someone will share my passion for plants and that you'll give me a follow. My Instagram is brad_the_phisherman.
