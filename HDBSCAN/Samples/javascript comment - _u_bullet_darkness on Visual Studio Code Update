/u/bullet_darkness on Visual Studio Code Update - new logo and many improvements
Ya I still actively use Webstorm for work and I love it, but it's a bit heavy. I love VSCode for working on smaller projects. I can get started on my project in seconds. With Webstorm it feels like minutes. And the advantages of Webstorm are slowly shrinking with these hot updates VSCode has been dropping. Although I hear Webstorm's next release will include Auto-import on Paste, which I am extremely excited for.
