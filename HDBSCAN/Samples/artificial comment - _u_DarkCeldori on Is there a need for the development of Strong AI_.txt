An example, we dont always assume the same consciousness has shared memory. The philosophy of eternalism, iirc, is somewhat backed by relativity. The idea is an eternal block time universe where all moments are simultaneous and eternal. In such a world consciousness exists along multiple moments at once. It wouldnt be much of a stretch to say it could exist in parallel too at different points in space just as it exists at different points in time.
