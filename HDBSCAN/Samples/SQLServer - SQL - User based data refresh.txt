SQL - User based data refresh
Hey everyone! I'm fairly new to running my own server and I'm trying to accomplish one main thing. What is the best way for me to have multiple users opening a single excel document (that is linked to azure SQL DB) as a table. Based on that user's permissions on the data set, the table will refresh. So Sales Rep A logs into Main Sales Report and only sees his sales data versus Sales Rep B opening and signing into the same workbook but based on her permissions, the table only shows her data. With the above, what's best way to set up user in SSMS? Extra info: data set in DB has Territory ID of 101, 102, etc that corresponds to Sales Rep. would love to be able to base a user's permissions off of that field. Let me know if you have any questions. Any help is appreciated.  submitted by /u/nmanselmo [link] [comments]
