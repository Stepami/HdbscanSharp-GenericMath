I want to learn new skills outside of university curriculum, what do you recommend?
Greetings guys, I’m a first year in CS major, but I do have prior knowledge about the basics of Pascal, C++ and Python, so the load this semester have been rather easy, and thus I wish to study on my own to deepen my skills and knowledge, specially that I am aware that university doesn’t teach you everything, and the work place is different than academia. We are studying C at university right now. What would you recommend me to do? I’m thinking maybe I should be continuing with C++ and learning OOP? (which we’ll do next year). Or maybe I try contributing to some open source projects on GitHub? But I am afraid I don’t have the level to do that yet. Or maybe I learn another language? (java or JS or another suggestion?). I’m kinda at a loss at what would help me build a more solid education right now, so I wanted to ask people with prior experience in the industry. As a note (in case it matters), I want to specialize in Software Engineering later on. And thank you.  submitted by /u/Hiromin [link] [comments]
