using const for function declaration
Hi, I'm completely new to javascript and a built in macro function or api to control a videoconferencing endpoint. They give example code as follows: const off = xapi.status.on('Audio Volume', (volume) => { console.log(Volume changed to: ${volume}); }); // De-register feedback off(); It behaves as follows: the function declaration turns on a listener, that feeds a string to the console whenever the volume is changed. What I don't understand is that calling the function with off() turns off the listener so that the code used as is doesn't do anything. Is my misunderstanding JavaScript related or api related?  submitted by /u/funkenpedro [link] [comments]
