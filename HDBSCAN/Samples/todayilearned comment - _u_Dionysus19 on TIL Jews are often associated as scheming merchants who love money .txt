/u/Dionysus19 on TIL Jews are often associated as scheming merchants who love money because in the Middle Ages Christians were forbidden to lend out money with interest, Jews were not.
Jewish nepotism does exist but no more than the nepotism that exists for any minority group. We focus on Jewish nepotism because the positions they hold are positions of wealth and power, yet we glance over the nepotism of Mormons or the Christians in Korea. The problem by assuming its pure nepotism is you are claiming that Jews conciously advance an organized Jewish agenda or favoritism on society which there really is no strong evidence for. Without that, just having a high number of Jews in an industry does not equate to pure nepotism. School districts favor hiring female teachers yet we dont claim that they control education. In the end these hired "nephews" still have to be qualified for the job, unless the business would fail. So the high proprotion of jews in an industry more equates to their history within the industry and their culture. For example, Jews practically created Hollywood and with that you have a man with pride in his business. That pride and mentality and clear vision of attainable succes in then instilled to your children. Now combine that with the close knit urban Jewish communites and all of you sudden you have created a culture focused around being successful in Hollywood. It is the exact same reason that the vat majority of rappers are coming from African American ghettos. So yes you can claim that there is some nepotism going on as there is with every single minority group. To attack the cultural advantage of Jews means you must also go after the black communties with hip hop and the asian community with college acceptance rates.
