Really disappointed by the complete lack of Worlds hype this year. It starts in the less than 15 hours.
Every year there seems to be a a number of different ways Riot approaches worlds hype, we've gotten songs, documentaries, short hype music videos, etc. This year, a song and...thats about it. Worlds starts in just about 15 hours from this post. It doesn't feel like it at all...I'm way less excited than I usually am for Worlds. And this is Riots first year doing Worlds while partnered with the MLB marketing team. What a let down.  submitted by /u/Hydruss [link] [comments]
