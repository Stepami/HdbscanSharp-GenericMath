Why haven't Mexican artists crossed over into mainstream popularity in the US?
With its proximity to the US, and the amount of people of Mexican decent living in the US, I would imagine someone from Mexico would cross over and become very popular. However it seems most of the crossover artists are from Puerto Rico, and some of the biggest also being from Colombian. Is there a reason for this? Santana could be an exception but he doesn't sing.  submitted by /u/FBAguy13 [link] [comments]
