/u/elder--wand on Supreme Court of India allows 13-year-old rape survivor to abort her 31-week-old foetus
My point is that killing the baby after the birth or before is the same thing  No its not, the concept of baby before birth does not exist. There is no baby before its even born, its just a fetus completely dependent on another human being, and to which I say it is only reasonable that the health and wellness of the one supporting a possible birth to be preferred over the one that is yet to be born. Its a shitty choice to make, and nobody here pretends that its not. But the argument that it is tantamount to "killing" a baby is just ridiculous, its more like saving a life when you only have the option of saving one which is the case here as the girl is too young.
