TIFU by wearing shorts instead of pants...
Back in 5th grade me and another kid got sent to go retrieve something from the gym closet without supervision. Gym was empty and all to ourselves. (thought it was awesome) We were running across it and the kid did a baseball slide ahead of me. He was wearing long pants mind you. Then I decided to follow suit and I did a baseball slide, on a polished gym floor, running as fast as I could, IN SHORTS. I cannot explain how bad that hurt. I have PTSD over it I'm pretty sure and that was 10 years ago. I can still hear the screechy squealing noise it made.. I was a tough little kid though and acted like nothing happened. Told no one and didn't cry. I remember sweating like crazy and practically shaking from shock or the pain or whatever. Made it through the whole day without anyone seeing the foot long open wound in my leg that literally turned completely black. tl;dr don't baseball slide in shorts on a gym floor (your leg turns black and there's a 50/50 chance you'll pass out from pain)  submitted by /u/Breithan [link] [comments]
