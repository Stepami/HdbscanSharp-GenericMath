Rebuild past version of table with CDC data (noob)
Hi there, I have multiple tables that will be having inserts, updates, and deletes going on pretty regularly. CDC has been activated on the database and the tables. Is there a way to take the information in the CDC tables and recreate what a table would have looked like on X date? Everything will be stored linearly, but how do you capture a date value for changes and then say "Hey, roll back all changes to just before 'this' date?" Would triggers be a better way to do this? Any help or ideas would be appreciated. I'm new to this whole thing. Cheers!  submitted by /u/TheMighty15th [link] [comments]
