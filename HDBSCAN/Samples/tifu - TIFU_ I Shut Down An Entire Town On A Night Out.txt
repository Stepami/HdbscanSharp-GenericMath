TIFU: I Shut Down An Entire Town On A Night Out
So this needs some context. I am from Ireland, and being 18 means I am part of a very well integrated, non bigoted, and non secterian generation. Generations above me however have had no such luck, living through constant war between religions, and stupid terrorist groups on both sides. Although small, these groups still exist today, and many use bombs and bomb threats to attack. On a Friday in 2015 a bomb scare was issued to 3 large cities in Northern Ireland, one of which was at an arts center I live by. My fuck up begins the following week when I went to go camping with my mates, who were already in a local forest. I met one mate at a pub with a rucksack on my back with camping supplies and we drank awaiting another friend to come and collect us. We got drunk and our friend never came, so we said screw it, let's go to the local nightclub. We took our vodka from my rucksack and looked around the town for a place to leave my bag for the night, to be retrieved on our way home. We chose the very art center that had been issued a bomb threat but a week before... We got very drunk, forgot about the bag entirely, and the next morning I woke up with a pounding head, no phone, and messages on Facebook on my computer, a link to a news article... My bag had been called in as a suspicious object, the police investigated and deemed it dangerous without looking into my bag filled with harmless clothes. A bomb squad was called in and the entire town was shut down, with no shops allowed to open on mainstreeet... I later confessed to the police and they understood that it was a miss fortunate misunderstanding. The chief inspector laughed with me and my father in the interview room that day when I realised I was nor a terrorist nor a bigot, but a bloody fool. TL;DR : Left my bag in a place that had a week before been threatened by a bomb, whole town was shut down because of it.  submitted by /u/OranNee [link] [comments]
