/u/ExceptionNULL on Azure B-Series as Domain Controller
Good use of B series. For a VM (pretty basic stuff) preview is likely completely fine. From what I've seen in the past, it can simply mean that they speculated to the best of their ability on how to price it, so price can go up, maybe even down once they've seen how it's used in the wild. Other than that there isn't much they could change. It's running on the same reliable infrastructure. Side note: It's not the B series alone, but often what gets overlooked about deciding which series to pick -- is there a chance that the VM will need to be resized in the future? Physical servers in Azure regions are grouped together in clusters of common physical hardware. So in order to do a simple resize you would either have to wait for the size you need to become available or you have to move the VM to another region. I can't recall at the moment which region (maybe all, hence perhaps preview), but there is no ability to resize the B series, but that's likely to change in the future. So when choosing a series also take a look at what it can possibly be resized to and if that's adequate for any potential need to resize in the future. edit: I was able to resize a B series just fine in east-us, so it's not overarching to all regions.
