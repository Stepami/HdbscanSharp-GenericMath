/u/838h920 on Iceland PM sold bank assets hours before financial crash, leaks show
are there any honest politicians?  Is there any chance for honest politicians? You need a lot of money and connections to have a good chance to get elected, and if you're honest it'll be way more difficult to get these things. This is why most politicians are all in on this shit. You've to be corrupt to have a chance, thus everyone is corrupt. There are only a few politicians left that are not corrupt, or more honest than the others and even if they do get elected, it's still them against many, which makes it difficult for them to make the world a better place.
