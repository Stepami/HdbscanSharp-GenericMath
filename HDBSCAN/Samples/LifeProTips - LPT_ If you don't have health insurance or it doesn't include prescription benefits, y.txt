LPT: If you don't have health insurance or it doesn't include prescription benefits, you don't have to pay full price for medications. Search for "prescription discount card" and you'll find all sorts of free and low-cost prescription benefit cards.
I don't want to mention the brand names of any of these. I signed up for one today, though, and it brought the cost of my prescription from $87 down to $21. The card is valid at CVS, Safeway, and a zillion other such pharmacies (with a notable exception being Walgreen's). Do a Google search and you'll find all sorts of these services. I'm sure some of them are better than others. There are probably some stinkers mixed in there with the legit ones. Do your research and make sure you feel comfortable with the company before signing up.  submitted by /u/FlexNastyBIG [link] [comments]
