sklearn randomforestclassifier divide by zero error?
I am trying to use a RandomForestClassifier for an nlp problem but when I try to use the predict_log_proba method I get a divide by zero error. I took a look at the results from predict_proba method and found that the reason is because some of the probabilities for some classes (there are a total of 8 classes) are 0. So when the predict_log_proba tries to apply np.log to 0 it gets an error. Does anyone know how to remedy this? If maybe i can format the probabilities so that it is close to 0 but not exactly zero? I know that predict_log_proba can be used correctly on a random forest classifier because I saw this example code use it and it worked fine: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/calibration/plot_calibration_multiclass.html Also I am using sklearn version 0.19 and the default parameter values for RandomForestClassifier.
