/u/UnrealLuigi on Finn Jones, The Immortal Iron Fist, Protector of Kun Lun, Sworn Enemy of the Hand Joins LUKE CAGE Season 2
Thought I'd have a little fun with the article title and use one of this sub's favorite memes lol Anyway, I hope it's does for Iron Fist what Jessica Jones or Daredevil did for Luke Cage and Punisher repsectively in making those characters awesome. IF was certainly better in Defenders, and strongest in his dynamic with Luke, so I look forward to seeing that develop more in Luke Cage S2.
