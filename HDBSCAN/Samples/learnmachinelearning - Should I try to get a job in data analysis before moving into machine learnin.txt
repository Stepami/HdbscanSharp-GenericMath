Should I try to get a job in data analysis before moving into machine learning?
I'm switching fields into data science and I love machine learning. Currently, I'm spending most of my time studying machine learning (and I just started studying deep learning). Is it difficult to land a job in machine learning without first landing a data analyst job? Thanks for the help.  submitted by /u/latetodata [link] [comments]
