Halt and Catch Fire's latest season is amazing.
I just finished Season 4 episode 7, and have to say it is the most beautifully constructed episodes I've seen in all of television. It was gut wrenching to the core, I cannot reccomend it enough. People are really sleeping on this show, calling it the worse Mad Men, but I really don't see that many similarities at all. Maybe in the first couple seasons, but not now. The show has gotten exponentially better, and this latest episode has really proven to me that the creators really care about making a spectacular show. The latest episode made realize how much character development can mean, and how much value we put on it, wether we realize it or not.  submitted by /u/WhenItsHalfPastFive [link] [comments]
