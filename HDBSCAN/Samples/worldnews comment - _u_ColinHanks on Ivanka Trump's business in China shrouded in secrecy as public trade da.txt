/u/ColinHanks on Ivanka Trump's business in China shrouded in secrecy as public trade data disappears
True, the problem is huge and grew rapidly from the 80s onward as China became the worlds manufacturing hub, but that being said significant progress in IPR protection has taken place since China joined the WTO and WIPO. Most notably China has recognized automatic protection of international copyrights under the Berne Convention, and modernized SIPO, the CPCC, and the Trademark Office of the SAIC. In 2014, China even introduced specialized IP Courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 2014. In 2016, Michael Jordan won an appeal in the People's Supreme Court for the rights of usage for the Chinese transliteration of Jordan after a 5 year legal battle with an initially dismal outlook. The name and a modified jumpman logo had been registered over a decade earlier by a Chinese company called Qiaodan which became moderately successful, and the ruling came as a surprise to many. More recently in August 2017, New Balance, a longtime target of long registered counterfeits 'New Boom' 'New Balund' etc. won a $1.5m USD judgement against the 'New Boom' manufacturers. Progress in the area of technical intellectual property as opposed to copyrights and trademarks will take more time, and the best course of action to prevent massive thefts, such as the F-35 --> J-31 fiasco, is to produce non-transferable technology domestically and implement effective counter-economic-espionage efforts at home rather than relying on China's treaty obligations and legal protections.
