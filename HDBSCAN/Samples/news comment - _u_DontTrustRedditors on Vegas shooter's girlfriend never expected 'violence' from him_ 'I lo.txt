/u/DontTrustRedditors on Vegas shooter's girlfriend never expected 'violence' from him: 'I loved him'
He had a motive. They're trying very hard to spin it like he had no motive, but nobody just does something like this without leaving a note or a taped message or something behind. In '66, a guy climbed a tower with nothing more than a strong and irresistible urge to kill. He had no idea why, no real 'motive' beyond that ideation. And it scared him enough that even he left a note saying he had no idea why he did it. A few years back, a guy shot a congresswoman because he thought grammar was a mind-control experiment, and he left a note. This guy left something somewhere. Maybe they haven't found it yet, or maybe they're trying to make sense of it. But I don't buy that there's nothing here.
