/u/Caraes_Naur on Newbie question: Can someone point me to a resource covering all the standard URL-fixing redirects a simple site would need?
None of these concessions are necessary to the functioning of the web server. They are conveniences for site visitors. However, very few visitors manually enter URLs or even know what one is anymore, so their necessity is limited. User goes to /somefile, the server defaults to treating somefile as a file and acts accordingly. User goes to /somefile/, the server defaults to treating somefile as a directory, which means outputting the directory index instead. This can be a list of files within that directory (the default most of the time, if allowed), or the first found among a list of specified files: index.html, index.htm, index.php, etc. Going to http://www.somesite.com actually results in a redirect to http://www.somesite.com/ because URLs are required to have a path (even if it's just /). If a resource isn't found and there are no further handlers, the server is required to send an error response. The server defaults to doing exactly what its specifications require (which never includes more than absolutely necessary), it has to be taught to do more, like correcting common user mistakes.
