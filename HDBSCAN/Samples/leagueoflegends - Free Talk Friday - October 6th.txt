Free Talk Friday - October 6th
Hey /r/leagueoflegends, it's about that time once again! IcyColdStare bringin' ya this week's edition of our Free Talk Friday thread! Hope it's been a good week#Worlds is full steam ahead, baby! No spoilers for the results just yet, but man...let's just say there's some interesting stuff going on in the Group Stage so far, eh? The new Runes system is still being experimented with on PBE! I stand corrected - the craziest thing I've seen so far is 10.30 AS Kindred. I can't help but wonder what people are going to come up with next.... That's it for this week! Short and sweet and most importantly to the point - now y'all can get to the real deal below! Same back and forth as it always is; play nice, talk shop and have a good weekend!!    submitted by /u/IcyColdStare [link] [comments]
