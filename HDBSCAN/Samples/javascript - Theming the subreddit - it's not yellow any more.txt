Theming the subreddit - it's not yellow any more
Also known as "how the mods fucked up readability", and I'll be taking the blame personally for that one. This post should probably have been the first thing up after the theming, but alas, it's here now. We're in the process of figuring out what kind of theme our subreddit could have. Right now, our baseline is /r/Naut with custom images, but yesterday, we had yellow colored links which was not good for a number of different reasons we agree with, so we reverted that. This will become a discussion thread about how we could handle a theme going forward, so please feel free to give suggestions in the comments.  submitted by /u/TheNumberOneCulprit [link] [comments]
