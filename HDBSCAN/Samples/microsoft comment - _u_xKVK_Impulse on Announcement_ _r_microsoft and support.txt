How long were you stuck at "Order Processed: Ready for UPS"? I bought an xbox one s bundle directly from the Microsoft website and all I got an email saying it was shipped but when I click the link all I get is the "Order Processed: Ready for UPS" message. I placed the order on Saturday and paid $16.99 for the express shipping. I'm not sure what to expect or what my next move should be.
