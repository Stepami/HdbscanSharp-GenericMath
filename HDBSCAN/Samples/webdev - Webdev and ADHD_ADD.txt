Webdev and ADHD/ADD
I'm sure there are many successful web developers who have either ADD or ADHD. Can I ask any of you what helps you get focused and stay on task? I absolutely enjoy web dev thus far, specifically front end. But I do find myself struggling to keep focused on whatever project is in front of me from time to time.  submitted by /u/skidmark_zuckerberg [link] [comments]
