/u/r-NBK on Huge log file on db that was change to Simple Recocery Model.
You are correct, a log file shrink is fast. One note of caution is that if there are open transactions that are using TLOG files (Think Inserts, Deletes, Updates, DDL) then the log will not be able to be shrunk past the active VLF. VLF is Virtual Log File, and a Transaction Log is made up of many VLF's. You can run DBCC OPENTRAN() to see transactions that are active and holding the Transaction Log.  Regards to /u/asmith0202, by default the Transaction Log will not AUTO shrink. You do have to follow the steps you mentioned first and manually shrink the file. However, once you do that it will be pretty quick... it's not like shrinking a data file where SQL Server might have to move data around.
