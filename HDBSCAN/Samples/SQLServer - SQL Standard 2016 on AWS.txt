SQL Standard 2016 on AWS
I need SQL Server 2016 with Reporting Services and Integration Services. The RDS product doesn't have those options, so I'm looking at a couple EC2 instance options. There are EC2 instances that come with Windows Server 2016 Data Center Edition and SQL Server 2016 Standard Edition. Does anyone know if I can add Reporting Services ad Integration Services to those? Or am I faced with getting a Windows Server 2016 Data Center Edition instance, and install MS SQL Server 2016 Standard myself, taking the options I need? In case you want more details: I'm specifying the US East / N Virginia region, r4.large with 1,000 GB of gp2 storage. The r4.large has 15.25 GB of RAM and 2 vCPUs,. An instance with SQL pre-installed would cost around $7,376 per year. An instance without SQL pre-installed would cost around $3,171.  I have two questions.. do my figures look correct, and does anyone know if I can install RS and IS on the instance with SQL Server pre-installed? I know that data egress adds cost.  submitted by /u/NotDavidWooderson [link] [comments]
