Looking for a technique to detect anomalies/faults in the following scenario.
I have a set of 4 temperatures (X,Y,Z1,Z2) in the form of time series data recorded throughout the day. Fault detection so far has been done by creating two contour/heat maps in Python where one of them has the value of Z1 at (X,Y) and another has Z2. The inverse relation in the following image is considered as an ideal situation and anything other than that is to be considered as a fault/anomaly. I am trying to automate the fault detection and looking for some discussion to help me think. Please ask if you have any questions or need any further information. Thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/bro_baba [link] [comments]
