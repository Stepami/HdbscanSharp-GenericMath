/u/gnarlyhose on My Nana in the 60's. She was a barmaid at the time. Beautiful then and now! It's her 78th birthday today.
Really? She has a strong "Doris" vibe, man. And not only was her Virginia Slims in a white, bedazzled leather case shaped like an elongated change purse she drank Gibley's Gin and tonic but never before 10 a.m. She preferred to be seated in a booth. She could clean and jerk 199 pounds in heels. She liked sardines and saltines. She couldn't go past a golf course without buying a hat from the pro shop. She had thick yellow toenails but Charles loved them.
