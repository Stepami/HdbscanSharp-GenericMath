/u/buschdogg on Las Vegas shooting: Stephen Paddock identified as gunman
Interesting... so you're saying my Muslim friends were actually terrorists who wanted to kill me? Who would have thunk? BLM does NOT fit the literal definition of terrorism. BLM is a non-violent movement that has some groups that they DO NOT endorse that did stupid things. That said, they never bombed a building and killed people or shot up a public area. You're being absolutely ridiculous in this threat and it's pretty funny. I'm not an Antifa fan, but if you want me to choose a group I'd rather be "attacked" by between them and a right-wing militant group, of which there are many more in this country than Antifa, I choose Antifa 10/10 times.
