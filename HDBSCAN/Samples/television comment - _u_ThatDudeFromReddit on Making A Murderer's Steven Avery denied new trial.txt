/u/ThatDudeFromReddit on Making A Murderer's Steven Avery denied new trial
Hmm, I dunno. Like I said the voir dire is out there and Avery's lawyers questioned him about it. I remember he responded pretty favorably to the idea of cops setting someone up, maybe they thought he might know some inside info about corrupt cops in MTSO or something. I would've struck him in a heartbeat but I'm not a highly respected defense attorney either. I also would've taken the option of having a non-Manitowoc jury, but they have stated they opted not to, because they thought it would be beneficial to have jurors that were familiar with his first wrongful conviction. But both of these things were calculated decisions by SA's very competent defense team, for better or worse.
