Is there a need for the development of Strong AI?
Weak AI development seems to me to be a much better use of time and research money than the development of Strong AI, say we were to make a strong AI, what would we do with it or are we researching it in a 'just because we can' manner?  submitted by /u/ckoppula199 [link] [comments]
