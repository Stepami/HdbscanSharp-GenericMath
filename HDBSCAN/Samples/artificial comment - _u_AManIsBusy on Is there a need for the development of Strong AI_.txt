/u/AManIsBusy on Is there a need for the development of Strong AI?
there would be some exponential growth where the strong AI could make a stronger version of itself and very quickly humans would be useless.  I don't believe this. Everyone says it as futurists, but they ignore economics and the full supply chain required to get metals out of the ground, turn them into batteries, circuits, and chassis, and then continuously recharge them with electricity, which has to be made at a power plant or taken from a solar cell (which also has the aforementioned supply chain required). Then, someone still has to pave the roads and sidewalks so that these robots can walk around. Someone has to manage the warehouse. Someone has to manage the machines that will manage the warehouse. Someone has to manage the traffic control system. I believe it will be a gradual progression with strong AI. Exponential growth, perhaps. Same is true with almost any major tech that gets adopted by everyone. I'm just saying that the initial growth will not be as fast as some thing. I do think that we can reach strong AI in our lifetime. It's not as wild as people think. However, I doubt we'll have no more humans working within the next 100 years because resources are scarce, and at the end of the day, it costs less to feed a human than it does to operate a massive robot with electricity. In fact, humans are already going to sit around and eat, so that's a sunken cost. It would cost almost no resources for them to work too.
