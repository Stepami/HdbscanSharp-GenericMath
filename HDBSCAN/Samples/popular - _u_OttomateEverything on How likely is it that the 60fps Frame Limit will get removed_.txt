/u/OttomateEverything on How likely is it that the 60fps Frame Limit will get removed?
In this case, "interpolation" is probably a better concern. Yes, decisions and changes can only be made with full updates, but it would be very easy to say at update point 0, the item is at position (x, y), and at point 1, it'll either be at (x2,y2) or get picked up, therefore we can interpolate the position of the item at any point in between. Currently the items are at "deciding points" every 1/60th of a second. You're arguing that the only "prediction" that could be made is user input, but you actually know exactly where items on belts will be in 1/60th of a second, you just don't know if they'll then get removed. In 1/120th of a second, you know exactly where it will be, because you know a decision can't be made until the next update loop cycle. That's the entire basis of FPS/UPS decoupling and how these systems work. You're arguing that you can't draw things any faster because decisions need to be made at every point in time. You're arguing that FPS can't be increased because of things that are inherently UPS decisions. You're completely missing the whole objective and premise of FPS decoupling in the first place. FPS increases can be made by just drawing the world in the implied states between the two UPS updates. The UPS system already "hand-waves" over the assumption that the item was in fact in the middle somewhere, so we can draw that state to the user without ever breaking any of the simulation.
