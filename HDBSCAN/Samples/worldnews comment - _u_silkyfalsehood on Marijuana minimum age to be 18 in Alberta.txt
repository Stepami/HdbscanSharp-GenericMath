/u/silkyfalsehood on Marijuana minimum age to be 18 in Alberta
This is true for many substances -yet the government doesn't step in and ban it. Maybe fast food should have a minimum age for consumption with this logic? How about credit? Maybe we shouldn't allow anyone to even qualify for credit (in any form) until they're 25. Every business aggressively sells to people, that's the nature of capitalism. Just because people can't always make good decisions, doesn't mean we should all forfeit our right to choose does it?
