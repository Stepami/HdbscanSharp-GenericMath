/u/sjturner15 on Something to think about: in the history of the NBA, only 4 teams have ever gone to the finals 4 straight times (celticsX2, Lakers, Heat) and LeBron James has a chance to do it for the second time in his career.
i mean that's a team accomplishment tho, i understand winning is important but if that's all you're basing this off then this conversation is over. you don't need to win 7 rings to be better than jordan, that's asinine, this is the most competitive and talent filled era in nba history. accolades also don't really mean shit either, as cool and nice as it is to note first team all nbas/mvps/etc, ultimately it's just awards given out from the a bunch of media guys. i prefer to just judge players based on what i watch and see and then make my conclusions. if you don't agree ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
