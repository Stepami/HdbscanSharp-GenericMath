/u/littlest_ginger on Which site model to use for a history website? Total n00b
Whew, thank you. I feel pretty intimidated by this stuff but you're right, we all start somewhere. I guess the target audience would just be anybody interested in exploring the history of the county. Lots of old images but also articles about interesting events/people/places. Links to other articles about similar events/people/places. Maybe I'll take a look at how atlasobscura.com is organized.
