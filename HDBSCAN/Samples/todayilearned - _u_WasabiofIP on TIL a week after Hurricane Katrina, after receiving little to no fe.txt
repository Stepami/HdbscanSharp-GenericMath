/u/WasabiofIP on TIL a week after Hurricane Katrina, after receiving little to no federal supplies, Sheriff Billy McGee stole 2 FEMA trucks full of ice from a U.S. military base to give to the citizens of Forrest County, MS.
It wasn't assigned yet, which means they were still assessing who needed it most. All of his points still stand: Sheriff still assumed that his people need it the most, his situation is unique, he's justified in breaking the law... etc. It sounds like an almost heroic act, but it's pretty selfish, or at least, arrogant; I mean he's the one going down for it so it's not like he did it for his own gain, but still a very self-centered line of thought.
