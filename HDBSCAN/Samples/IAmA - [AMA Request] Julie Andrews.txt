[AMA Request] Julie Andrews
My 5 Questions: How do you feel knowing that you've impacted the lives of so many people? Are you satisfied with your career? Did losing your singing voice impact that satisfaction? Have you ever felt like The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins, was your biggest success? How did this motivate, or demotivate, your creative ventures? How would you suggest young people overcome a feeling of "not good enough", or anxiety around creative work? Do you have any regrets surrounding your fame?
