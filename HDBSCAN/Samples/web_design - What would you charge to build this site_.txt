What would you charge to build this site?
What would you charge to build this website. Would need to be able to upload a list of customers attending an event. Customers can then go to said website, enter their information, and then it would pull up all the sub events this person is taking part in. The customer then has the option to purchase via cc option A, option B, or both for said event (or multiple events, as some customers are only in one event, and some are in several). Once they place their order it would send an email, or notification somehow to the sales desk, that would then process the order, and then be able to press a button, or something, and it will send the customer a text notifying them their order is ready to be picked up. Design would just need to be simple, and extremely mobile friendly, as 95% of the orders would be placed on a mobile device. If you need more information post it here or message me.
