/u/3Dgykid60 on DACA was just rescinded. I am a 34 year old illegal alien DACA beneficiary who will soon be deportable. Ask me ANYTHING.
I guess you weren't here when Spez outright said that the_donald was being censored. Also, you have to look for anti liberal stuff. Auto-subbed subreddits and general subreddits that do not blatantly state political affiliation do in fact delete postings and ban users. I've even seen examples of users being banned for just participating in far-right subreddits. Statistically, reddit is very left leaning as well: very bottom on the pic
