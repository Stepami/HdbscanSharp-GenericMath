/u/TheUltimaXtreme on With all this Destiny 2 hype, people need to remember how awful Bungie/Activision treated their community with the first game.
Yeah, people don't seem to realize the lead director left during that critical phase of production. Realistically, a competent company would have given their developer time by delaying the game, but Activision's hand is just as much puppeteering Bungie's development as Bungie themselves. Bungie did what they had to to get the story workable, but they knew it was bad. I don't condone the actions regardless. Fuck buying "THE COLLECTION" at $60, I bought the game used on both my 360 and One for $10 a piece, and at the very least, I did get a $20 experience, but nothing more.
