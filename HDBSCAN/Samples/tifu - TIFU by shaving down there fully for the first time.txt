TIFU by shaving down there fully for the first time
First TIFU post and this one actually happened today. I'm still youngish and I just recently started shaving and I decided to shave my pubes. You know because I've heard people say they do and thought that's what people preferred just in case something ever happens I mine as well get used to shaving. It went alright at first shaved it pretty low but it itched and the hairs would poke around and it really hurt so I decided to shave it all off. Remember I'm new to shaving so I looked up what to do but didn't really follow anything I read. I did it all dry which kind of hurt but it was fine and to get rid of it all I went against the growth (idk if that's a bad thing to do or not) and we'll it worked mostly. It hasn't been too bad so far but I realized there was a lot of hair in my razor so I just pulled the hair out of it and worked from there. It worked a couple times but eventually I got what I deserved for being stupid about it. I cut my thumb just well enough to not be too big but when anything touches it it stings. I decided I'll just stop and clean out the cut and put a band-aid on it. Everything seemed fine at first until now when I'm laying in bed trying to start to go to sleep because I have school in the morning. Everything down there itches and the hairs kind of hurt (don't know how to explain it well) but when anything touches them they just hurt. Now I just can't wait to finally sleep and hoping that it can grow back quickly. TL;DR shaved my pubes for the first time, tried cleaning out razor and cut my thumb bad but not too bad. Now I'm in bed and everything itches I can't sleep and I want to be awake for school at least one day this week. I feel like I kind of deserved it though for being dumb about the whole thing. At least I learned from my mistakes. Is this NSFW? I'll just mark it to be safe  submitted by /u/Njswet [link] [comments]
