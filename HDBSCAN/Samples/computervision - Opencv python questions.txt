Opencv python questions
Hello /r/computervision I love working in this area but I am new. I had a few questions you may be able to help me with or at least point me in the right direction. My first question was if it is possible to detect shapes that are abnormal, I understand finding contours and I can find basic shapes but what if we have a rectangle but with a dome on top can I do a detection for that? Or a rectangle with a hexagon on top. I was also wondering if it is possible when detecting rectangles for instance from a video stream to only detect once and then stop so I don't keep applying OCR to that same region for example. Thanks for any and all help! I will continue reading through opencv documentation.  submitted by /u/opencvisfun [link] [comments]
