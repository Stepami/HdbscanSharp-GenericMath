What is a good method to deal with time series data in tensorflow?
I know I want to convert it to protocol buffers. Presently the data is in start/stop dates. There's way way too much data to make a separate frame for every day, for instance. I understand this is kind of a big question, is it mainly going to be preprocessing in python (non-Tensorflow specific code) to get tensorflow the data it needs or are there Tensorflow specific libraries or methods for dealing with this kind of data? Any good tutorials? Thanks in advance, (It's the WSDM churn kaggle btw)  submitted by /u/ryanbuck_ [link] [comments]
