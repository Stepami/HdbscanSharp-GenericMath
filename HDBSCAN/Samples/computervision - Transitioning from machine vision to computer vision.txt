Transitioning from machine vision to computer vision
Hi all. i am looking to make a small career jump from machine vision to the slightly more interesting realm of computer vision. i have very extensive experience in implementing shallow neural networks, 3-D point cloud processing and a-lot of vision guided robotics (2-D and 3-D). Most of my experience has been using Halcon, but I have also gotten a chance to dabble in openCv whenever possible. I was wondering if anyone here had made a similar transition and could give me some pointers, and things to look for in potential jobs.  submitted by /u/hubetronic [link] [comments]
