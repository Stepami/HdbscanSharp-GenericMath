/u/throwaway_lunchtime on Used .NET Core for a while? What are your thoughts about it?
Given that 2.0 was just recently released, anyone who has been using it for a while has probably experienced some pain as things changed. If I didn't have years of experience with the full .Net Framework, I would probably have a much more positive view of Core. I've been working in a script generation project that is running on 1.1. I forgot it was running in Core until I added a reference to a real .Net dll so that I could use nameof(Entity.Property). VS-2017 let me add the reference, but generates errors on any entity properties that are nullable.
