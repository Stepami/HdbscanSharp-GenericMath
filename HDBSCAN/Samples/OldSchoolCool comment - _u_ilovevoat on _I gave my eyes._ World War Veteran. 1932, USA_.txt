Unlike the man voted into office those people earned their money through hard work. They started out just as regular joes and understand what it's like to watch your mom work two jobs or go to bed hungry. Those millionaires never forgot what it felt like to grow up poor and have the police stop you for no reason. Those millionaires risked their jobs to point out how messed our police were being to our citizens and they are doing more than kneeling. I appreciate them for standing up for us. It's more than the rest of the NFL is doing. They are not being disrespectful, the people pretending everything is okay are being disrespectful, the people tying veterans to a flag are being disrespectful.
