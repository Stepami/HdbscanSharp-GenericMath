/u/Schmabadoop on People of reddit, what's the most annoying thing a guest has done after you said "make yourself at home?"
More funny than annoying, but a good friend in high school would come by, chat and hang for a bit, rummage the snack drawer and leave. We're still good friends but I poke him about his old eat and runs now and again.
