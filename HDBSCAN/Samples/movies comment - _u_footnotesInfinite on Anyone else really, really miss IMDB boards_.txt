/u/footnotesInfinite on Anyone else really, really miss IMDB boards?
I do. I always have questions about movies but they usually are about very obscure details. I felt like I'd always get some useful sort of answer there on IMDb and I'm not finding that anywhere else. It really allowed me to find the folks who cared a lot about a specific movie and were able to talk about the minutiae. And I could answer questions on specific movies I felt I had some insight into.
