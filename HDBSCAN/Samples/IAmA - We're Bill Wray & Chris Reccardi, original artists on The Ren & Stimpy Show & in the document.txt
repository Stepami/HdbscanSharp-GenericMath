We're Bill Wray & Chris Reccardi, original artists on The Ren & Stimpy Show & in the documentary Happy Happy, Joy Joy: The Ren & Stimpy Story - ask us anything!
From Bill Wray of Ren & Stimpy to William Wray the fine artist, talks to me about whatever you dare ask! - BW We're supporting the documentary Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren & Stimpy Story. Help the film get funded here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/happy-happy-joy-joy-the-ren-stimpy-story-cartoon-animation/x/17266768#/ I'm also curating a show in Culver City entitled "Pink" with an eclectic group of artists including Chris Reccardi & Glenn Barr, and more important LA fine artists. You should be able to find if online. It will be from Nov 30 - Dec 3 in Culver City, CA at the Castelli Art Space.

But I'm still answering away! BW EDIT: I think we've barely touched on a lot of stuff behind Ren & Stimpy and we've only heard my point of view. The documentary that Ron & Kimo are doing has a whoooooole lot more material and nobody has memory is perfect. So hearing different points of view within that documentary will give you a fuller picture. I hope you can find a way to support it so we can get it done! Thank you for the questions!  submitted by /u/renandstimpydoc [link] [comments]
