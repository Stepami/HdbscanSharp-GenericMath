/u/DontKillMyVibePlease on Boxing match between Roy Campbell and Dick Hyland, 1913.
Wow old people aren't tough? Wow what a shocker. /s. People where tougher in 1917 not because they where physically stronger, but because they could cope with harder situations and they could withstand more hardship and physical work than us.  Naa, people weren't tougher in 1917, you just think they were. You clearly never leave your fucking house if you think no one goes through hardship/physical work nowadays. The only reason you have this idea is because you watch too much tv/too many movies and think that for some reason our glorious racists, misogynistic past is something to be proud of? Also gj for twisting words bruh.
