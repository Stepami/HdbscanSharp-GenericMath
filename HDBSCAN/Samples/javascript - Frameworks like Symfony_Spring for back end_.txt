Frameworks like Symfony/Spring for back end?
So I write in many languages and when it comes to frameworks for back end...why isnt there a good one for JavaScript? By good one I mean a framework that makes everything for you. For example in Symfony I can use doctrine to generate database tables, entities, controllers, crud actions API routes, views... you name it. And this leaves only the business logic for me. If I try to do the same with Node.js and use Express i need to make my own routes, generate schemas, include mongoose to use them...basically set up everything. I cant just insert several commands in the console and everything to be set up and ready. Why is that so?Am I missing a framework that does that?  submitted by /u/JayceForTheWin [link] [comments]
