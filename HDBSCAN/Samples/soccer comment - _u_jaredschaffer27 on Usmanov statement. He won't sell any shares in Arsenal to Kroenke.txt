/u/jaredschaffer27 on Usmanov statement. He won't sell any shares in Arsenal to Kroenke
You've never heard of convicted rapist Owen Oyston? That's a shame, because not only does he own a club, but he was also tried and summarily convicted of the crime of rape. Imagine if he were to rape again, having previously been convicted of rape (Owen Oyston, I mean). He would therefore become doubly convicted rapist Owen Oyston.
