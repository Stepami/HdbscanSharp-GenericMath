Lucy 2 officially not in development. Wasn't before. Isn't today. Won't be tomorrow. (Full statement on the current state of journalism by Luc Besson within)
From Luc Besson's Facebook post: Dear journalists. You do a great job, noble and useful. You investigate, cross-reference the information, then you recut it so that the truth, of which you are the spokesperson, can be heard. What an honor for you to inform, prevent, guide, decrypt even ... But that was before. Before the Internet and your unbridled and idiotic race to the scoop. It does not matter if the info is right or wrong as long as we're the first to say anything. To hell with ethics and morals. Let us take up a foreign article and let us simply translate it, without perspective, without discernment. When did you lose that faith? When did you give up? We may make films that you don't like, but we apply, often for years, to serve our love and our faith. Please try to regain your dignity, your nobility, your courage. We would need you so much in this very difficult time. Take it easy. Respect yourself. For the record: No I'm not preparing Lucy 2. Neither yesterday nor tomorrow. Yet this fake news went around the world thanks to you .... You will tell me: "It's not a big deal." It's true, you're right ... but it's "fake" and normally this word shouldn't be part of your vocabulary, because if we can't believe you, how do we hold a democracy?  submitted by /u/hombregato [link] [comments]
