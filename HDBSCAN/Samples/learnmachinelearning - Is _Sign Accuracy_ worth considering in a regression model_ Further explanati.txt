Is "Sign Accuracy" worth considering in a regression model? Further explanation in details.
This may be a weird question, but let me do my best to try and explain myself: Say I'm working on a regression problem that is trying to fit a target that has both positive and negative values. Mathematically speaking, and assuming that there is "class balance" (equal amount of positive and negative target values), is there any value in optimizing towards models which are more effective in predicting the correct sign (ie positive / negative)? Or should I focus exclusively on RMSE or MAE or other cost functions (because any variance in "sign accuracy" is by chance)? I'm asking because the sign of the prediction is equally (if not more) important than error. And before you suggest focusing on classification, I am doing that as well, but I am using both in an ensemble. Hope that makes sense -- thanks in advance for any insight / help!  submitted by /u/zacheism [link] [comments]
