[D] Are there keras-like training utilities for tensorflow?
Hello. When I'm using tensorflow, I often find myself struggling to replicate keras training utilities. I often need a progress bar with loss monitoring, validation loss and metrics at the end of batches, early stopping, learning rate decrease callbacks... I can do it myself but it's a pain and it's time consuming. I'm not sure tflearn is what I want but maybe I should invest time to get how it works. Tensorflow is really convenient for model definition but I find training code messy. What do you usually do ? Thanks  submitted by /u/Jean-Porte [link] [comments]
