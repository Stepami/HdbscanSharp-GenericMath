/u/ForegroundEclipse on In-depth Irelia guide for all you folks
i'm disappointed that warmogs is not part of your staple build, and you mention nothing about irelia generally not needing boots if you manage to acquire a deadman's plate, and at 6 items should sell her gold inefficent boots. Also, lifesteal quints are garbage.
