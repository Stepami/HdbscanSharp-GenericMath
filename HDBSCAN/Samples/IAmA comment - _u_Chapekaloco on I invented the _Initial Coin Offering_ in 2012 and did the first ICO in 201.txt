/u/Chapekaloco on I invented the "Initial Coin Offering" in 2012 and did the first ICO in 2013 AMA!
Only considering withdrawals - do you think that a BTC ATM network will be able to compete with other platforms such as TenX, Monaco, Tokencard, Centra, etc, that are looking to provide debit card style access to one's crypto funds from any ATM or brick and mortar point of sale? I am not familiar with each card's fee for this type of access directly to FIAT (nor if all of them support withdrawal directly to FIAT), nor am I with BTC ATM fees, but for example sake TenX plans to charge a flat EUR 2.75 for ATM withdrawal. Or perhaps do you think they will coexist rather than compete? Since for example you can -purchase- BTC through the ATMs, which is something I don't believe those platforms are looking into doing. Furthermore, I don't remember the last time I visited an ATM to withdraw cash. And in the rare instance I actually DO need cash, I just ask for cashback after a purchase with debit. I understand that some people will never dive past surface level of the world of cryptocurrency and are perfectly happy utilizing a familiar, easy ATM to buy/sell BTC even if it means some fees, but outside of that, if TenX and company are on the scene, it feels like that will be their sole utility, and that sole utility will cater to a small demographic to boot.
