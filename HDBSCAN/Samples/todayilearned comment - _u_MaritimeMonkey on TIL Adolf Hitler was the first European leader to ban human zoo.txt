/u/MaritimeMonkey on TIL Adolf Hitler was the first European leader to ban human zoos, a popular attraction in Europe where exotic peoples were paid to be on exhibit for onlookers, with recreated habitats and shows. Belgium was the last to ban them, in 1958.
What in the actual fuck are you talking about? Africa isn't a country, Belgium didn't control "Africa", just Congo. How is it supposedly the Belgian colonialism that's the "cause of many problems" and not the entirety of the Scramble for Africa? Besides, it was a private colony of Leopold II during the worst of it. When it was actually under Belgian government control, it improved a lot. Up until it became another Cold War target, it was looking to be the most prosperous country on the continent.
