/u/darnbuttin on Engineer vs Manager
I’m a manager at a fast food restaurant and I know it’s a low position in society compared to managers being referenced in this joke, but speaking from experience, crew members will always think of new reasons why managers are lazy assholes compared to themselves even when some people bust their ass to get where they are and bust their ass to stay where they are.
