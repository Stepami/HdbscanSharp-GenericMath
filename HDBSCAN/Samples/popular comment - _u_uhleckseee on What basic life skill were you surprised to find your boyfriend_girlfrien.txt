/u/uhleckseee on What basic life skill were you surprised to find your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse didn't have when you first started dating?
One of my exes could not understand why I said it was constantly inconsiderate to me for him to constantly be late. Going to pick him up, I'd call him to say I was outside and it would take him sometimes upwards of 10 minutes to get to the door. When I was with him, I saw what it was. Finishing whatever video game objective he was working on, finally brushing his teeth, putting on his shoes, and kissing everyone in the house (family) goodbye. He got pissed at me because I was upset he was over an hour late to my house (we lived less than 2 miles away from each other) because he started talking to his dad. "Well, isn't it rude to my dad to get my phone out and start texting you if he needed to talk to me?" NO MOTHERFUCKER. That's the polite thing to do!
