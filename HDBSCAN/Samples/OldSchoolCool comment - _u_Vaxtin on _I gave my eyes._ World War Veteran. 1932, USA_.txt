Actually I just looked it up: the president has the sole authorization to launch nukes--there isn't somebody that has the authorization to stop the president from sending the orders, and the nuke system is designed to be able to launch (almost) immediately and all it takes is for him to give the go ahead literally whenever. But if he acts on a quick whim and just wakes up one day and says " let's launch the nukes"--while he can do that, the people below him who get the orders ( a long list to make sure the orders are real) can say "nah, fuck that" if it's really an unorganized attack that wasn't planned or needed. If the US plans to launch a nuke it'll be planned for months -- and everyone will be expecting (maybe not the population, but the people in the nuke command). So trump going rogue and launching a nuke randomly isn't reasonable. Apparently the biggest concern is under split second thinking--like if trump was woken up at 3am being told that so and so country is about to or already launched nukes towards us (example). He'd have to react extremely fucking quick and rationally in a scenario like that, which some people think he's incapable of doing (the dude sends tweets out in the middle of the night with poposterous meanings).
