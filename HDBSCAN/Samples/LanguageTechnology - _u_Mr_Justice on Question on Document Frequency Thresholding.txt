/u/Mr_Justice on Question on Document Frequency Thresholding
Dodgy paper from not well known universities in China? Count me in! I'll go through it when I get the chance, and hopefully comment something interesting back. P.S.: Not saying the paper is bad, I haven't read it yet. Simply that I'm always intellectually skeptical when I see papers like that. Curious how your professor got to know about it...
