[Discussion] I'm an undergraduate in CS and just entered my final year. I have an idea for a final year project in computer vision. I want to achieve a top grade in this but I'm afraid I don't have enough knowledge to do so. What do you recommend?
Just to give a bit of background on my course. We have done an introduction to AI class, algorithms, stats, probability and discrete mathematics. This project will done over the course of a year. My idea is to develop a human action recognition system. What I envisioned was to implement a system that is similar to this. I mentioned to my supervisor that I wanted to achieve an A grade. He said that achieve the A grade in this project I would need to have an extremely good understanding of what going on under the hood instead of just calling APIs provided by libraries like opencv, tensor flow, dlib, etc. He told me that the concepts behind this project are very mathematical and complex; and me as an undergrad won't be to understand it, especially in a years time. So what kind of topics do you recommend that I could do a project on in a year and also show that I have very good understanding of computer vision concepts? I would be prepared to put in the work researching. How complex would gait analysis be? Like recognising friends by walk. Maybe it could be just tracking a human and see if they cross into some restricted space? Let me know what you think anyways, thanks.  submitted by /u/phreak121 [link] [comments]
