[D] In the Searching with policy and value networks section of the AlphaGo paper why do they compute moves using the supervised learning network instead of the reinforcement learning network?
In the definition of u(s, a) they seem to compute moves using the supervised learning network p_sigma. Why don't they used the reinforcement learning network p_rho?  submitted by /u/spline_reticulator [link] [comments]
