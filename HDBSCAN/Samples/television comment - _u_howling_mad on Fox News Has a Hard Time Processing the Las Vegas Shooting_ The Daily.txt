Because they have rules? That's a major oversimplification, and you know it. There's a number of reasons we have gun violence issues (I'm not specifically speaking about these kinds of major events). Most of them are social/economically and race related--no one wants to talk about these. There's an obvious mental component, and that stems from a major defunding in the 70's through today. We're unique, very different from a makeup then other countries. You can't compare countries that are 80% homogenous, nor those that are small. This is a vastly more complex issue then people want it to be. We can ban all of them tomorrow and the difference at the end of the year will be virtually nothing. They aren't going anywhere, so we need to look for better options. No one disagrees that we need to do something, but it needs to be measured and well thought-out. So called bans or stupid and ineffective laws are nothing more than vote grabs.
