Is Informational Technology part of Computer Science or vice-versa?
I am about to become a senior in high school and finding out what I want to major in is important. I love learning about computers but recently I realized that I didn't want to become a programmer, but something else in computer science. I was wondering if informational technology was part of computer science or vice-versa.  submitted by /u/ontariobay [link] [comments]
