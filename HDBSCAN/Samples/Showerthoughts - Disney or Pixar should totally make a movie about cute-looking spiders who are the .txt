Disney or Pixar should totally make a movie about cute-looking spiders who are the good guys, thereby taking the younger generation's fear of spiders.
There could even be a scene where a spider is shown to get lost in an apartment and is grateful for the human who like takes it out with a cup and paper and lets it go free.  submitted by /u/AliceTheGamedev [link] [comments]
