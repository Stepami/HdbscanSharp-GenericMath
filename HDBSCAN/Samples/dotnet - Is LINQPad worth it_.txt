Is LINQPad worth it?
I remember a while ago a few coworkers really championing LINQPad. Is it still worth its cost today? It seems like its killer functionality is that it can connect to a database, generate a LINQ to SQL context for easy querying, and dump the results in nested grids. Is this correct? If my database doesn't have foreign key constraints for its foreign keys, this is a lot less useful, right? Does anyone here use it? What do you use it for? Would you recommend it? Does anyone have a license and no longer use it? Why did you stop using it?  submitted by /u/spuriousfive [link] [comments]
