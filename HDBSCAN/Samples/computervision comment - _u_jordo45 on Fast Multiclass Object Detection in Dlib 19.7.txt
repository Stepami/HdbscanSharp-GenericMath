/u/jordo45 on Fast Multiclass Object Detection in Dlib 19.7
Thanks for the quick reply! Iâ€™m training it on kitti at the moment. So that will give a decent comparison.  Awesome, I'm excited to see that. Although, the main benefit is that it works on smaller datasets. Dlib comes with an example that trains a face detector from just 4 images. Try that with Yolo or SSD :)  I certainly appreciate that benefit, and have used it to help in building up larger datasets :)
