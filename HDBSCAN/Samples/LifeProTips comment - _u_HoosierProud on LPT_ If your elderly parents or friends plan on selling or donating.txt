/u/HoosierProud on LPT: If your elderly parents or friends plan on selling or donating old items in their house before a move or garage sale, teach them how to research the value of items online, or help them yourself.
Side note. If they have something valuable, teach them the proper way to sell it on eBay or Craigslist without getting burned.
