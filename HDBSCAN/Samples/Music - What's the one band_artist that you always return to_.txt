What's the one band/artist that you always return to?
So a couple of years back I was listening to bands like SOAD, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit etc. While having a drinking marathon me and some friends found out about Rise Against and I fell in love instantly, I couldn't really remember the music the next day but their name I could, so I listened again and again and again to their music, now, 4 years into the future, and mainly listening to Punk like, The Exploited, Misfits, Casualties etc, their music is still what I listen when I'm feeling like I'm down in the ditch because their music just hits so close to home. What's your band you always return to because it just moved you so much?  submitted by /u/TheAnarchoX [link] [comments]
