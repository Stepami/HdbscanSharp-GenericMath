What keyboard do you use?
Hello reddit! I'm a student and I have been studying computer science, however I don't find my old membrane Keyboard that much comfortable anymore. It's becoming hard to use and I can't type comfortably. I need a new one, so who to ask than the people who do what I dream of doing for a living. What kind of keyboard do you redditors use on a daily basis or at work?  submitted by /u/acicc [link] [comments]
