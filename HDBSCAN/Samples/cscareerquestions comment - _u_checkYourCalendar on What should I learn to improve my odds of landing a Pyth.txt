/u/checkYourCalendar on What should I learn to improve my odds of landing a Python dev. role, coming from a non-tech background?
Hey! I really appreciate your response. You've given me hope. Yeah, I just made the decision to go back to Django. I'm also picking up good coding practices as much as I can, and most of my OOP practice comes from Django. But can you tell me more specifically about what you mean by CS fundamentals? And if you wouldn't mind, how would you gauge your programming skills by the time you first got hired? Any specific libraries and skillsets that you learned that you think helped your resume?
