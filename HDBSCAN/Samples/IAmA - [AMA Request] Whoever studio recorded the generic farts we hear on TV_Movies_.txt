[AMA Request] Whoever studio recorded the generic farts we hear on TV/Movies.
My 5 Questions: How did you find out about the opportunity? What was the recording session like? What was your compensation, if any? How did you prepare your digestive system for the recording session? Can you distinctly tell your farts from others on TV/Movies?
