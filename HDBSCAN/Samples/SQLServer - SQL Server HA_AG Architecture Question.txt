SQL Server HA/AG Architecture Question
I haven't tried this configuration before and I'm still getting used to designing High Availability setups. One of my coworkers suggested this and something about it just seems...off and I'm hoping for a second opinion. Basically, we have two data centers (DC1 & DC2) that are equal in stature (one is not designated DR). For the sake of argument let's say I have 20 databases and I'm looking to "load balance" them between the two sites and still maintain a viable DR solution. The plan that was floated was to set up a Failover Cluster in each DC, split the databases between the two and then set up Availability Group replication with the opposite cluster as the other member. Databases in DC1 would replicate to DC2 and vice-versa. So, in the event of the loss of a DC, ownership of all databases will pass to the other cluster. The clusters would be sized so that they could handle the load of all the databases in a DR situation. Is it possible to make one cluster the source of one AG and the target of another? Is it advisable?  submitted by /u/mr_shush [link] [comments]
