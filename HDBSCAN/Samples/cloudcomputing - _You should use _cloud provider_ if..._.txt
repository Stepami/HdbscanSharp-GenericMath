"You should use <cloud provider> if..."
There are so many cloud VPS/server providers out there, it's hard for me to figure out for whom each is right. I have decided to jot down some of the niches, and pros/cons, of the various cloud providers, please give me your thoughts and add some of your own suggestions. AWS: "First-to-market" momentum for cloud IaaS, spectacular for enterprise (especially if you're managing a large-scale network of systems, which is a requirement for many enterprise customers) but hostile towards hobbyists, far greater depth of services than other providers, rock-solid fault-tolerance, awesome customer service, immense cost savings if you migrate your datacenters to the AWS ecosystem (e.g. S3, RDS)  Azure: Great if you're working in a Microsoft stack (.NET/C#/ASP/MS SQL Server), good for hybrid clouds  Google Cloud: Runs on Alphabet's pre-existing infrastructure (which means much better peering); up and comer with blazing fast I/O and interesting AI-related services but let down by Alphabet's reputation for terrible documentation and questionable platform stability; more cloud flexibility  Digital Ocean: More dev-friendly and good for hobbyists (e.g. blog, personal builds), but lacks the redundancy/backup/compliance functionalities of the larger players which means it's not good for enterprise  IBM SoftLayer/BlueMix: IoT and Watson integrations, competitive advantage in some of their APIs, bare metal/non-virtualized servers  Heroku: Low-hassle, turnkey managed web application deployment; excellent for beginners, hobbyists and tinkerers   Endnote: Providers about which I know nothing: Vultur  Hetzner  Rackspace    submitted by /u/lambdaexpress [link] [comments]
