/u/autotldr on The Beauty of the Go Programming Language
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 97%. (I'm a bot) A) An introduction b) Why was Go needed c) Target Audience d) Go's strengths e) Go's weaknesses f) Towards Go 2 g) Go's design philosophy h) How to get started i) Who is using Go.IntroductionGo is an open source language, created at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Lack of dependency management - The Go1 promise means that the Go language and it's library cannot change it's APIs over the lifetime of Go 1. Probably in Go 2 :).Towards Go 2I really love the way the authors have taken such an open source approach towards the language.
