How do American programmers compete with Eastern European guys?
browsing through freelancing websites and there are just thousands of people from all over the planet like Eastern Europe and India that charge $5-$10/ hour. These guys have like 10 years of experience, degrees, and hundreds of projects. How in the world can an American developer compete with this? Why doesn't the entire world just hire these people instead?  submitted by /u/Barcaticket [link] [comments]
