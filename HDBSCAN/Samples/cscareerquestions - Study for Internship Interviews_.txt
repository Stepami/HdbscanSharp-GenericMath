Study for Internship Interviews?
College has a career fair this upcoming week. My resume is all set up, I just don't know what to expect ? I've heard they choose people and then give them interviews. Will I need to study the same way I would for a job (CTCI, leetcode), or do I just be able to talk about languages and my future goals ? I have a degree from a two year college, and this is my first year as a transfer to a university, so I'm a little unprepared for coding questions as there's still a lot of things I have no clue how to answer. Tl;dr how would you study (if at all) for questions on an internship interview ?  submitted by /u/badluckbryce [link] [comments]
