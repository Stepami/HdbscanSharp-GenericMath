Forced into being a Mercy main, then pulled back in when I try to avoid playing Mercy
My main account is a Mercy main (by choice). My second account (started season 3), I originally started to specifically avoid healing at all. I managed little to no healing for that season. But for seasons 4 and 5, I decided to wait till the last two slots were left, and I picked to fill the role the team needed. Inevitably, the role needed was healer. Like 80-90% of the time. So for those two seasons, my time played showed me as a Mercy main. For season 6, I was determined to not play a healer at all, again. As soon as we load in, I pick a non-healer hero. And I don't change if no one else covers the role. Usually, after everyone haggles about it, someone else picks at least one healer. Last night, though, I immediately picked Symmetra on Anubis defense. After everyone else had picked their hero choice, we had no healer at all. Everyone said we needed a healer, but no one would switch. Then someone pointed out that I was a Mercy main (apparently looking at my previous season stats). "The one player who is a Mercy main isn't playing Mercy. For some reason." Oh. My. God! So I got sort of "shamed" in to playing solo healer that match. It annoyed me. And I complained a few times during the game. This is very unusual for me. I'm always very easy going and accommodating. I'm always the compromiser to keep peace and sanity in a team. But this is ridiculous. Everyone derides Mercy mains, but no one lets you out of the slot. This is like the exact opposite of wanting to be a certain main, but everyone wants you to switch off. I'm trying to avoid being a certain main, but everyone wants me to switch on.  submitted by /u/Bullgrit [link] [comments]
