/u/poundfoolishhh on Vegas shooter's girlfriend never expected 'violence' from him: 'I loved him'
Do people not know what a conscience is anymore? "I called her up immediately and she said, 'Relax, we shouldn't worry about it. I'll fix it. Do not panic. I have a clean conscience,'" Danley told her brother, "I didn't have anything to do with this," Bustos said.  This is a brother and sister having a private conversation: a brother who is obviously losing his shit at the idea that his sister may have been caught up in something horrific, and a sister reassuring her brother she had nothing to do with it. "Clear conscience" doesn't mean "I don't feel bad for these dead people". It just means "I didn't do anything wrong".
