Worried about starting my CS degree
Hi, I'll keep this short and sweet but pretty much I'm now in my first week of doing computer science and I'm a little bit worried that I'm going to fail miserably. I didn't take maths at an advanced level prior to my course and already we're being taught (and examined) on maths related content. I'm certainly willing to work towards improving on the maths side, but I'm worried about how much this will hinder me over the course of my degree. So my main question is: should I already be working on improving my maths to higher levels (I don't really know where to start though) or will I most likely be taught the advanced maths in such a way where no prior knowledge will have been required? To add on to this, if I'm really fucked because of my lack of mathematical knowledge, would software development or 'computing' on it's own be a better degree to try and switch to? I know that programming is what I want to do but I haven't decided on a career yet. TL;DR how much is my lack of maths going to hinder me throughout the course of my CS batchelors degree? Thanks very much :)  submitted by /u/DanNyan [link] [comments]
