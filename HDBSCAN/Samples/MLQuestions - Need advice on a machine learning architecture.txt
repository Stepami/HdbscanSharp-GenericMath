Need advice on a machine learning architecture
Hello, I am considering using a machine learning approach to solve a problem at work. I have a set of input data (raw job titles) and need a program to output a SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) code corresponding to the input job. Being the list of SOC codes are approach-ably finite, the use of machine learning for this project seems feasible (from my admittedly inexperienced perspective). My question is, What would be the most appropriate machine learning model for such a problem? I have done a little research and have come to the conclusion that a Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) would be the best choice. What do you guys think? Is using this architecture overkill? Or am I underestimating the potential complexity of the problem. Thanks for any help! More Information of SOC codes: Standard Occupational Classification codes are characterized by a general industry prefix (Ex. "11" in 11-2021.00 corresponds to "Management Professions") and a SOC code suffix corresponds to a more specific job title (Ex. "2021.00" in 11-2021.00 corresponds to the job category "Marketing Managers").  submitted by /u/razuik [link] [comments]
