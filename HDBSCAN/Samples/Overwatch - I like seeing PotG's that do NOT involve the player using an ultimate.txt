I like seeing PotG's that do NOT involve the player using an ultimate
You know, the ones that show the real skill of the player, instead of simply pressing Q. I know some may argue that sometimes it takes skill to use your ultimate and do well with it - for instance Genji. But for me personally, I don't really enjoy any PotG where the player pressed a button. A single button, once. Even the Reinhardt charging the enemy team off a cliff is great, or the Orisa pulling the enemy team off a cliff. Because they still require more than simply pressing a button once. The best ones are things like Widowmaker, getting many successive kills or Lucio pushing 3 people off a cliff, one after another. Or even the rarer Mercy getting multiple kills. I love the non-ultimate PotG's.  submitted by /u/mouseno4 [link] [comments]
