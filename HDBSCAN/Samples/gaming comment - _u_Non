/u/Non-Sequiteer on Grinding for the sake of grinding
Dude this is so refreshing to hear you have no idea hahaha I bought Destiny 2 after being burned by 1, but the Taken King left a bit of a hopeful taste in my mouth so I was willing to take the Destiny 2 Reviews seriously when they said "every problem from the first game has been addressed." Like are you kidding me? I was furious through out my entire play through because I just couldn't believe how comfortable these reviewers were with throwing out blatant falsehoods. The story is garbage, the villains are garbage, the supporting characters are more bland garbage, and every cutscenes is a test of my patience as I watch my ghost say every word my character wants to say. Like they could have at least been like "oh something went wrong when the ghost first brought you back so you can't speak, but your ghost can talk for you." They just decided "eh, it doesn't matter." Like even in Destiny 1 you said a few words, they've got so fucking lazy and people won't stop jerking them off for it. The story is soooo uninspired, it doesn't actually tie anything from the first game into this game. Destiny 2 is one big retcon, and the worst thing is it's not even a good one that takes the stuff that bothered us and turns it into something sensible and interesting. They just stick with this philosophy that "if we constantly tell the player how important something is they will feel how important it is, that way we don't actually have to build the world up around the player, we can just pretend everything is interesting and important." It is so frustrating to watch the company that got you interested in game development devolve into a money grubbing charlatan. It's even more frustrating to watch as thousands of people fall for the act.
