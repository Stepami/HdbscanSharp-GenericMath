/u/vmxvdihf on What is the immediate followup course/course path from Andrew Ng's free course?
Hello? Does nobody want to answer this and help me? Why not? I'm trying to learn as much as I can as quickly as I can to break into this field. What are some good direct followup options from Andrew Ng's free Coursera course? If you're going to downvote, at least explain why you're downvoting. I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this, but I couldn't think of anywhere else, please direct me to the right subreddit if it's not appropriate to ask this here.
