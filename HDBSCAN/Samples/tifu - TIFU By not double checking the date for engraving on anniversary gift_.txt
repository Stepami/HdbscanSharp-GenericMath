TIFU By not double checking the date for engraving on anniversary gift.
This isn't a big f up on this subs standards and I definitely expect this to drift on into the wind. So a few days ago I ordered a small Misuzi Necklace that comes with two discs where you can add a custom engraving. So on the first disc I got our nickname 'BOM'. On the second disc I'd decided I'd have the date I asked her out, 24/11/15. But to my discovery this afternoon when it arrived, me in all my wisdom and glory and skill in self checking wrote the 24/11/16. Like how can I even screw that up. I mean I get i asked her out when we were transitioning year level so I just assumed oh I asked her out Year 11 so clearly that's 2016. But really Choski are you that stupid. There goes your perfect beautiful little gift. So know I'm just gonna sit on this chair and slowly pick at my kebab and think about how I've just thrown away $150 that isn't mine and how she's gonna feel whenever she looks at it or might wear it. Thanks for letting me vent. `TL:DR Got wrong engraving on gift. Threw away money that wasn't mine and now thinking about life choices  submitted by /u/Choski_r [link] [comments]
