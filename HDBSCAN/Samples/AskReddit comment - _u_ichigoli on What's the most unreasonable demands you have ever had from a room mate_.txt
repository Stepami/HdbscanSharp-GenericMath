/u/ichigoli on What's the most unreasonable demands you have ever had from a room mate?
I had a potential roommate get declined getting an apartment with me and my fiance because he, a single individual with no prospects, wanted the master bedroom and threw a shit-fit when we said we two would be taking the larger bedroom. We explained that there being two of us on a permanent basis, we would need the extra space and the response was, and I quote, "This isn't fair! You just assume you get the bigger space and I'm not gonna get to have any say in anything cuz you'll both just out-vote me!" Like... my guy... we're splitting rent 3 ways, not by room so you're getting a good deal. The master bedroom was a 9 sq ft difference (We measured) and we offered to forgo a dining room in favor of letting him use it as an office but NO, he was getting a raw deal. So that fell through...
