Two priests were playing golf...
Father Bob hit his ball into the woods on his first swing, "Damn it! That totally missed!" he cursed. "You shouldn't curse Father Bob!" said Father Michael "Or god might punish you!" Father Bob apologized and they went on playing. On his next swing, Father Bob hit his ball into the sand pit. "Damn it! That totally missed!" he cursed again. Again, Father Michael warned, "Do not utter such words Father Bob, least god punishes you for it!" Father Bob apologized again and they continued playing. On his third swing, Father Bob hit his ball into the pond. "Damn it! That totally missed!" cursed Father Bob once again. Before Father Michael could say anything, a ominous dark cloud suddenly gathered out of the blue sky and a vicious lightning came down and stroke Father Michael, killing him instantly. Father Bob was completely stunned, before he could understand what was happening in front of him, he heard a thunderous deep voice coming from the sky - "Damn it! That totally missed!"  submitted by /u/zyzeast [link] [comments]
