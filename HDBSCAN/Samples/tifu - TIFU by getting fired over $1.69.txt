TIFU by getting fired over $1.69
In true TIFU fashion the actual fuckup was about 2 weeks ago. I worked at a gas station chain. I had worked at this store for almost 3 and a half years. I was the assistant manager and had the respect of my district manager, manager, and all of the salespeople at my store. 2 weeks ago I was eating my dinner at work. Nothing out the ordinary. After finishing I decide I'd like some pork rinds. I go and grab them, eat them, and absent mindedly throw the bag away when done. I had intentions of paying for them but due to the fact that I had thrown them away I forgot. Fast forward to today. I walk in today and the DM says she needs to talk with me. Yesterday I had a person walk out on their shift and quit. I assumed this conversation was going to be about that. She tells me that 2 weeks ago I got some pork rinds and didn't pay for them. Asks if I have an explanation. I didnt. I ask if I can pay for them. She says no, home office won't allow it and that I am to be terminated. She felt really bad about it but after having seen it on camera she had to follow through with it as it was company policy. Fortunately she offered to be a reference on future job applications. 3.5 years at a company where I had never been written up prior today and I was fired over a simple, absent-minded mistake Tl;dr got fired for accidentally stealing a bag of pork rinds after 3.5 years  submitted by /u/IrishBurreeto [link] [comments]
