Best tutorial/training options for MCSA certs?
I'm looking to get the basic MCSA database development cert., and looking to do online training. They list a bunch of On-Demand partners that offer the training (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/on-demand-course-partners.aspx). If this is the best route to go, are there any that have a good reputation, or any to avoid? Or is there another training/tutorial I can take that will allow me to learn enough to pass the exams? I would like some kind of structured training...there's only so much I can do with the test databases that come with the Express version. I've never done any kind of certifications before, so I'm a bit overwhelmed with all of the info, any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  submitted by /u/EmrysAllen [link] [comments]
