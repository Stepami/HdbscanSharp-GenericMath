/u/Greenmanssky on The EU is taking Ireland to its highest court over its failure to make Apple pay tax
How about business just pays their damn taxes, or take their company and shove it up their ass. You either pay tax in the country you're operating in or you don't operate, it should really be that simple, but companies like Apple, Google, amazon etc pay less than %1. Everybody else has to pay their taxes. Oh that's right, the super rich can do whatever they want, and the law doesn't apply to them in any way, shape or form
