/u/batmansmk on [P] Solving Atari games with Distributed Reinforcement Learning
I would not say optimally necessarily. In Breakout for instance, you find out an algorithm which makes it impossible to loose (for instance with a stateless system, you reach back a known state without dying). So you can reach any score. But does the trajectory of the ball leads to the fastest way to reach any score? You can say you solved the problem, but the algorithm is not optimal in terms of speed/complexity etc. But I would say you solved the problem nonetheless. Optimally is probably not adapted here.
