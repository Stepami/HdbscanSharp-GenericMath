Best solution for a free landing page for my domain?
I've purchased a domain for my music endeavors, and I'm looking for a free service that will allow me to create a landing page for it with just a background image and the ability to create hyperlinked invisible buttons on top of an image I've created with social media icons already locked in place. I paid a whopping $1 for the domain, and I don't really expect to get many visitors to the site, so I'm not really looking to pay for a service, so I would be fine with setting up forwarding to a site with a separate domain name. Any help is appreciated!  submitted by /u/jereMyOhMy [link] [comments]
