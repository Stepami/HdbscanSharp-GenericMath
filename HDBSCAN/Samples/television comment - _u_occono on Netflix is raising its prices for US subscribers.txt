/u/occono on Netflix is raising its prices for US subscribers
No, if it doesn't have what you want don't pay for it. My point was just against the complaint in general as I've seen it. I've seen complaints that Netflix has things people hate like Adam Sandler movies, and then also complain about having to overspend on niche streaming services. You can't get a huge library of everything you want specifically for $10 a month.
