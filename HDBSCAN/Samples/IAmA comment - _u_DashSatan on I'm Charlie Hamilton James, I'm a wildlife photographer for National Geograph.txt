/u/DashSatan on I'm Charlie Hamilton James, I'm a wildlife photographer for National Geographic Magazine. Huge fan of vultures and sea otters. Today is World Animal Day so AMA!
Hi Charlie, for as long as I can remember it’s been my dream to be a wildlife photographer for Nat Geo. I recently upgrade my camera to the Nikon D500 for this reason (though still saving up for a good telephoto lens). What would you say is the best way to get on Nat Geo’s radar as a photographer?
