How to detect a manipulation of a device from a stream of accelerometer and gyroscope data?
I have a hand-held device with 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope (e.g. a smartphone or an arduino with the appropriate sensors connected). I want to detect when the device is suddenly taken in hand(s) and raised up above the person's head. The problem is, there is no defined starting condition - the device might be in a pocket, already in the hand, on some non-moving surface, if carried the person might be standing still, walking, running, jumping... The only thing I know about the starting condition is that it is not the target position (above the head) and that the person must take the device and raise it. Also, the speed of this manipulation is not exactly defined, i.e. it could be done very quickly or slowly (but I can define an upper limit on the length of such manipulation for it to count). What would be a suitable algorithm for detecting such manipulation under such conditions? My first guess was to use a neural network (or SVM or any other kind of classifier) whose input would be a window of samples from the stream (of the length corresponding to the maximum allowed length of such manipulation), trained using a dataset I would have to build by experimentation. However, I have a feeling that this approach is not going to work (well). I have also posted the same quetion at stackoverflow but haven't received any feedback whatsoever.  submitted by /u/zegkljan [link] [comments]
