Hotel Website: Where to display a small Trip Advisor 'Award of Excellence?'
TL;DR I have a hotel website and want to know where exactly to display a Trip Advisor award. Hi all. I'm the admin of a small boutique resort (site here). Trip Advisor has several widgets that we can place on our website . I'd like to place one such widget (see here) on the site, but I'm not sure on the best location. This is my first time editing a hotel website, so I'm open to any and all suggestions with regards to best practice, highest impact, etc. Maybe I should cross post to /r/userexperience? I'd take suggestions on that as well :-) One option could be to overlay the widget onto the slider. In fact one of the pages on the site already has a similar overlay (screenshot here, and page here). Maybe I could add the Trip Advisor widget to the same location on the slider for each page? Or maybe I could add the widget to the top right or left corner of the slider? Just thinking out loud here. The decision to place the widget was handed down by management. Thanks in advance.  submitted by /u/cag8f [link] [comments]
