LPT: Don't ask a veteran if they ever killed someone. It is both the first and worst thing a veteran gets asked about
Edit: I love my veteran so much and it makes me want to cry when complete strangers and even children ask him this. And people who fire random gun shots and set off fireworks any time they please are inconsiderate assholes! Please keep talking, he is crying and laughing reading your comments. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. Edit #2: To all the ignorant twats who said my husband knew what he was signing up for, your mom signed up to have a baby but she ended up with an ignorant asshole for a kid. Did your mom see any "action" when you were in? Also men were drafted in some cases and didn't sign up for shit  submitted by /u/RightMeow0129 [link] [comments]
