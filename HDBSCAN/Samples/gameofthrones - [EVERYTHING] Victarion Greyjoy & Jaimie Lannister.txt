[EVERYTHING] Victarion Greyjoy & Jaimie Lannister
Although it most certainly won't happen i'd love for Jaimie to take the "position" of Victarion in the show... not his storyline or his purpose, but his hand! For Melisandre to give him his hand back, so he can finally complete his redemption arc by getting another chance of using his skill, but this time to use it in protection of all that is good. I just don't see what he is going to accomplish in the north, at the moment he's not a great commander, or a great anything really... but perhaps that's the point i guess, not going because he's got much to offer, but because it's right. But how badass wouldn't it be if the kingslayer slew the night king?  submitted by /u/Vasilcin [link] [comments]
