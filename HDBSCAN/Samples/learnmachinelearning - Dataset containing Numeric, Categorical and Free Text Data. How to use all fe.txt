Dataset containing Numeric, Categorical and Free Text Data. How to use all features for Machine Learning?
For supervised/unsupervised learning problems, both regression and classification, most tutorials I come across focus on: Numeric and Categorical Data  OR Text Data (e.g. free text on a form, tweets, documents, books etc.)  But I have not seen many tutorials that focus on datasets where we have data that is numeric, categorical, and text as part of the same dataset. What tactics, techniques and advice is available to apply machine learning algorithms to data that has all three? Do we train on the free text and other data separately? Or do we feed in all features (extracted text features, say bag-of-words or TF-IDF say) to an ML algorithm? How do we do this? How would we go about: Data Cleansing, Feature Extraction and ML? Looking for advice, tutorials, books etc.?  submitted by /u/abc_its_easy_123 [link] [comments]
