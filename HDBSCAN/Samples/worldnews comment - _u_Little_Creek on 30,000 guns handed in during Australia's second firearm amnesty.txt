/u/Little_Creek on 30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty
Fucking strawmen. I never said guns caused crime.  Only implied they they did. I never said America was a blood stained wasteland.  Just that Americans were paranoid at being shot, which sort of implies something now doesn't it? New Hampshire is a wealthy and predominantly white state. It's actually a perfect example of how improving the socio-economic situation improves total quality of life and safety.  Glad you agree that guns have nothing to do with it then. The fact that the lowest murder rate state STILL has a higher rate than the whole country of Australia surely supports my point anyway.  Really? A state where anyone can legally purchase a machine gun? Anyone can walk into a gun store and come out in 5 minutes with a handgun and you think 0.1/100,000 strongly supports your argument? Really? Really? Especially if you consider there are 1.3 million people in New Hampshire and 23+ million in Australia.  Well then I guess you can't make any comparisons between Australia and America then since the population disparity is so great.
