/u/Bohbren on proud of my personal website so far, but it's a work in progress. need any and all feedback i can get!!
This looks really good. I'm a big fan of simple websites. They are easy to navigate and don't fluster the user. How long have you been learning web development? Are you planning on freelancing? I'm just curious because I'm in the middle of learning web development myself and I'm constantly trying to learn as much as I can from different people.
