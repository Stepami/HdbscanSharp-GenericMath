/u/lukewarmmarmite on Changing behaviors may be easier when people see norms changing - "In a study, people ate less meat and conserved more water when they thought those behaviors reflected how society is changing."
We already knew this surely? Also this is predicted by a relatively old theory for what influences behaviour - theory of planned behaviour. Basically our intentions to perform a behaviour are influenced by three main factors, subjective norms (ie OP's post), attitudes towards the behaviour, and level of control over that behaviour. Yes I'm great at parties.
