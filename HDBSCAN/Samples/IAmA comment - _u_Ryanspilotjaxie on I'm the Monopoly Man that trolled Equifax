I havnt seen any rich people do what im doing. Very rich people are a part of another social sphere and theyve agreed with each other to be above their man made law as long they all stay true to not rocki g the boat. If you see rich people rocking the boat is is stage almost all the time. I am poor, the reason i didnt get hurt was because i gave up this world to ask for and do the will of God. God will comfort through death in this world or keep a person safe in this world if anyone does the same
