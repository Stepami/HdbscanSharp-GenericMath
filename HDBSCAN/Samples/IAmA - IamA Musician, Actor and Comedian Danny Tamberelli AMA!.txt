IamA Musician, Actor and Comedian Danny Tamberelli AMA!
Forgive me reddit for I have sinned... It has been 5 years since my last AMA. Reddit sucked me back in when people couldn't get over that I was Arnold on the Magic School Bus and Jizzle from GTAV. Some of you scolded the newbies for not knowing about Pete and Pete and All That. Some of you liked my band, Jounce. Thank you. I am here to set the record straight and chat about whatever you want that pertains to my experiences as a child actor who didn't get an E! True Hollywood Story. I am without Colorado Kool-aid, so I might have to take a break to go get some. EDIT1 It's 5:30, gonna go take that break and come back later. Thanks for your questions and hanging with me this afternoon! I'll pop back in later tonight and answer any other questions you kids wanna know. EDIT 2 Im back poking around again at 835pm EDIT 3 its 1135 and im gonna call it. Thanks for an excellent day! I will see your posts as they are linked to my normal reddit account so I will get back with answers to any further questions. *My Proof: https://twitter.com/dtamberelli/status/905476648975392769  submitted by /u/dannytamberelli [link] [comments]
