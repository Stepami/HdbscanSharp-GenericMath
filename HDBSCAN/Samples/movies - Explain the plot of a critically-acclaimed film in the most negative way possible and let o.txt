Explain the plot of a critically-acclaimed film in the most negative way possible and let others guess the film you've described.
As an example, the following; A alcoholic, past-his-prime, sexually/emotionally abusive, former special unit police officer is manipulated by a major corporation through his old boss to hunt a group of dangerous fugitives who are just trying to live their lives. Along the way, he'll throw the rule book out of the window trying to find clues, intimidate without just cause, murder in public and run from the world to avoid questioning both his existence and the definition of humanity.  submitted by /u/CorsairVI [link] [comments]
