/u/tomthebomb96 on Is there any way to create a password protected repository to upload projects onto for interviewers to see?
At my school it's against the honor code to publish assignments/projects on github because people can copy it. Even though you wrote it yourself, they consider publishing it to be just as bad as plagiarizing it and will penalize them equally. One of my teachers last year bragged to us about how he was able to get some dude's degree revoked/nullified officially because he caught a current student copying their github... Not cool
