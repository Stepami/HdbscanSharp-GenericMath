LPT: to save space when moving, wrap breakables in your (clean) casual clothes instead of bubble wrap.
Obviously don't use any clothes that can't stand to get creased, or any breakables that might leak. But for the most part, tableware and electronics will survive just as well if wrapped in old band T-shirts, which then won't need their own box.  submitted by /u/darkshiines [link] [comments]
