/u/invictusNeuro_ on Patterns in electrophysiological data
Thanks for the responses so far - much appreciated. Sorry for not being clearer. @dYz - I'll definitely check out scikit-learn for python; thanks for the heads up! I think I'm just seeking validation on what may be the most appropriate classification methods for the data I have, what the best practices are in machine-learning are (i.e. is there a natural progression from simplistic models to more advanced?). @Optrode - thanks for this perspective. I believe we are looking at pure rate coding, but I'm not entirely too sure as I'm new to the field. If it helps clarify anything, then this is the typical data I am currently looking at.
