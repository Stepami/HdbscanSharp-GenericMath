Aiming to pursue a CS PhD - is double majoring in math worth it?
I'm currently earning my BSCS with a math minor, planning to graduate in 3 years, but have the capability to double major in math if I stay for 4. Is a double major worth it for pursuing an AI-focused CS PhD? Or should I just settle for the minor and start my PhD a year early?  submitted by /u/Asadron [link] [comments]
