/u/glengineer on Former President Barack Obama announced in a video on Wednesday that he is inviting civic leaders from around the globe to Chicago next month, where they will exchange ideas and plan ways to solve some of the worldâ€™s common problems.
I don't read anti-Obama blogs, I was suggesting that you do, to see what it is that people don't like about his policies.   I'd say that it's far worse, now, what with people's premiums doubling or tripling, and deductibles in the thousands making the annual cost of Obamacare upwards of $10K for a family of three or four. The lying about it is an incorrect revisionism - there's a difference between trying and failing and lying. <  Johnathan Gruber, Architect of Obamacare: "Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical to get for the thing to pass" Cuba - Fine, let's open the borders with Cuba. i agree it helps us, and would further state that free trade would quicken the end of Cuban communism. But since the Cuban government wants this too, lets get them to make some changes that we want, e.g. human rights policy changes, more real freedoms for its people, open ubiquitous internet, rather than making it all one sided on our part. Iran - If what you said were true, sure. But the Iranians started cheating on the deal before the ink was dry.
