[AMA Request] Embedded Engineer
My 5 Questions: What are you working on right now? How strongly would you recommend a Master Degree in Embedded Systems to a student? Is an embedded systems' engineer easily employable as "software engineer"? How much is your salary and how much is an average salary in your country? How is your average working day?   submitted by /u/sabino_ [link] [comments]
