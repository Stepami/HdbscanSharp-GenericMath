Beginner here
So I'm not to curious about learning SQL as I've already been doing that for awhile. I often use it for querying spatial data in ArcGIS. Now the majority of my company uses SQL server 12 or 14 (I'm not to sure) and I'd like to get familiar with the software. I'm off work for the rest of the week due to Harvey so I figured now would be a good time to learn. I have downloaded SQL server 16 express but would like to know how I would go about installing databases like AdventureWorks or even the ones from the Mere Mortal 3rd edition.. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!  submitted by /u/wowthatsabigpotato [link] [comments]
