/u/GuardsmanBob on Is there a need for the development of Strong AI?
Depends on how you define working, furniture factories exist but some people still enjoy building a chair in their garage. Even if all farming was automated there are still people who enjoy growing their own food. I like solving programming problems, I'd still do it if all programming was done by machines.
