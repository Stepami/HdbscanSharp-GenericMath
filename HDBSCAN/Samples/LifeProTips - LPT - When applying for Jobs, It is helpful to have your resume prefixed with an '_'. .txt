LPT - When applying for Jobs, It is helpful to have your resume prefixed with an '_'. It makes the resume file move to the top of the directory it is in and makes your resume more visible.
But on the flip side, It can annoy some Hr executives who are irked by this so YMMV. It did help my case a lot so that is there ;) On the other plus side, It makes it so much easier to upload if it is in a directory with a lot of documents.  submitted by /u/helmenthor [link] [comments]
