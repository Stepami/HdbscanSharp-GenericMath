/u/snakeiscranky on TIFU with airport security
I have a small perfume vial that is housed in a case to look like a bullet. It’s called ‘Juliette has a gun’ and I bought it purely for the novelty and because it smelt good. I recently travelled overseas and completely forgot it was in my handbag as it’s quite small. I got stopped every time I went through any kind of security for the entire trip and had to explain it wasn’t an actual bullet by pulling it apart each time... I don’t think it will be living in my handbag from now on.
