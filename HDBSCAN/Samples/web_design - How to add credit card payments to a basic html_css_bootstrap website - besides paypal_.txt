How to add credit card payments to a basic html/css/bootstrap website - besides paypal.
We have a client who has a nice html website. We have created a paypal register now button so that members can register for upcoming events. However they get reports all the time (supposedly) that people without paypal accounts can't figure out how to pay via credit card without creating a paypal account (even though it is fairly obvious on the paypal checkout screen). What other services out there would allow me to paste some code in and have people pay via credit card without setting up an account? Square? I don't want to have to add a full ecommerce back-end.
