I'm a Nocturne main who's streamed purely for charity for 3 years, not accepting personal donations. This is my fourth 24 hour stream this year for Extra Life!
Today I’m doing a 24-hour charity stream raising money for children’s hospitals through Extra Life! Usually there is one allocated day for the 24-hour stream event but I have been doing them throughout the year, roughly once a month to raise awareness and bring in more donations for the kids! I've so far raised just under $600 this year, and $1.3k overall. Come by and say hey, just taking it easy and having some fun throughout the 24-hours with primarily League of Legends - I might play other games throughout but I'm pretty poor so don't have many other games haha. www.extra-life.org/participant/magpiemorgan - The charity page where you can donate and it counts on my profile! www.twitch.tv/magpiemorgan - My twitch page to come watch. I read in the rules that Charity streams are an exception to not posting streams, so I'm hoping that Extra Life is one of the valid allowed ones  submitted by /u/IrSpeshul [link] [comments]
