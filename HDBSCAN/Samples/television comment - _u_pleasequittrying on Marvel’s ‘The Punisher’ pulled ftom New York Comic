/u/pleasequittrying on Marvel’s ‘The Punisher’ pulled ftom New York Comic-Con.
thats the worst thing they could have done... if people cant differentiate between real and fiction in tv, then they shouldnt watch it. why "punish" all violent shows just because there was a shooting? people died, yeah, and its shitty, but it has nothing to do with a tv show. thats why there's ratings. if you watch something on netflix its usually unrated or rated mature like this show is, so thats on the person who watches it on whether or not they can "handle all of the violence". the show/character is about brutal justice, not mindless killing.
