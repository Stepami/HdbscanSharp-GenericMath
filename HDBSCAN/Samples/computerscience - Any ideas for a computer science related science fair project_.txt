Any ideas for a computer science related science fair project?
I am currently trying to find an idea for my science fair project and I was hoping that I could do something computer science related. It would be nice to base my research topic off of one of you guyâ€™s suggestions. I own a laptop and phone of my own, but I do ask that the suggestions do not involve me taking apart these devices. I am familiar with the basics of a few different coding languages and I would be willing to learn more about these, but due to time and schedule constraints I ask that if there is coding involved it is not too extensive and complicated. That being said, any advice is useful to me. Thank you!  submitted by /u/Jack_Big_Rigglester [link] [comments]
