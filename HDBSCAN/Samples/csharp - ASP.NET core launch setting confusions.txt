ASP.NET core launch setting confusions
Under launchSettings.json, Each profile has a "commandName" field filled with either "IIS express", "IIS", "Project" or "Executable". I understand the IIS/IIS express part but what do "Project" and "Executable" do? Are they magically linked to the correct command/executable file or else how exactly are they interpreted by the runtime? Additionally, is launching with IIS/IIS express using Kestrel + IIS and Project/Executable using just Kestrel? I know I am asking a lot of questions. Thanks for bearing with me.  submitted by /u/markshen818 [link] [comments]
