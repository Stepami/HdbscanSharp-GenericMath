Well, let them! Who watched closely knows williams, ferrari and mclaren were very evenly matched that year, with rumors of williams having a very slight edge. Schumacher generally won cause he was the best driver of the 3 cars, raikkonen a bit worse, montoya a bit worse; people try to say raikkonen should've won the title due to worse reliability he had, and forget that he won like 1 vs 6 (not sure exactly but more or less) races vs schumacher in similar cars.
