[Everything] GRRM hinted at Jon's real name in the books in a pretty genius way.
Aemon Targaryen giving Aegon (Jon Snow) Targaryen the same advice he once gave to his late brother Aegon (Egg) Targaryen just before he was made King! “Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel," the old man had said, "the same counsel I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born." The old man felt Jon's face. "You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.” ― George R.R. Martin, A Dance with Dragons Fact that Aemon's brother Aegon happened to be the King on the iron throne and Jon is an Aegon who is the heir to Iron throne is pretty clear hinting now in retrospect.  submitted by /u/DeeHi [link] [comments]
