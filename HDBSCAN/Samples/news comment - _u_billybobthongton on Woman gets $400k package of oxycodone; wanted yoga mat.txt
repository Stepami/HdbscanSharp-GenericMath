/u/billybobthongton on Woman gets $400k package of oxycodone; wanted yoga mat
I'm assuming you mean the controlled drop thing? And yes to weapons, I don't think so to nukes, at least no failed ones with nukes that I know of. The weapons things were ATF plans named Operation Wide Receiver and Operation Fast and Furious. The ATF allowed people to sell guns to straw buyers who would then take them to mexico and pass them off to the cartel. The plan was to follow the firearms to the cartel, but it didn't work (at least in the most recent one, not sure about OWR). Basically they lost track of a bunch of the shipments and they got into the cartels hands. They are all in a registry and still pop up from time to time to this day.
