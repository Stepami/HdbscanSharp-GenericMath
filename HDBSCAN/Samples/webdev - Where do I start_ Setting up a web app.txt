Where do I start? Setting up a web app
Hi all, It's been a while since I've done any (limited) dev work (college) and wanted to try to create a project. It consists of a few parts: Running once a day: 1. Access Google flights API and return set of flight data 2. Upload results to database 3. Query dataset 4. Create exportable file In my past I've built some webpages using php, but in this case I don't want to create a webpage. I just want these processes to run on a server and create a .csv file. So the technologies are a little different than anything I know. Are there any resources on how to get started on something like this? Can someone help point me in the right direction? My thought was to use the free tier on AWS. I don't plan on processing large amounts of data by any means, but i would like the database to relational. Thanks in advance!  submitted by /u/temperedExpectations [link] [comments]
