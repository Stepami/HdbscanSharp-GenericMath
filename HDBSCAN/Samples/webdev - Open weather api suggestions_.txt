Open weather api suggestions?
Has anyone recently used an open weather api they might recommend? I've seen a few recommendations here and there but they're a bit dated. Just seeing if there's anything fresh and preferably free or affordable for an experiment/portfolio project.  submitted by /u/DingGratz [link] [comments]
