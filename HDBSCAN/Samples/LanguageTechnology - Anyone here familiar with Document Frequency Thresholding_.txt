Anyone here familiar with Document Frequency Thresholding?
I think this might be the right sub, but if it's not I am sorry. It's still about NLP anyway. I'm still new to the topic and still trying to familiarize myself with a lot of things. Recently I got myself to learn about Tf-Idf, but apparently it's not enough for my research. I read about this feature selection technique called Df Thresholding. Basically, you use some kind of thresholds to decide whether certain features (terms) really contribute to the classification or not by looking at its document frequency (Df). I've tried to google it but every search result only points to Tf-Idf article and not the Df thresholding I am trying to learn. I wonder if you guys could link me to some articles or shed me some light on it. Thanks.  submitted by /u/sentient_machine [link] [comments]
