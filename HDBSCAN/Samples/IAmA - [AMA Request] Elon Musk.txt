[AMA Request] Elon Musk
What plans do you have for the future of renewable energy? Are there any forms of renewable energy that aren't widely known that could be sustainable in the near future? What is the current status of SpaceX? I've heard of something called "TheVenusProject", have you? Is TheVenusProject something you've considered looking into, and how achievable is a future like that?  Edit: If you would like to contribute to this AMA please include your question and keep it on topic. I'm not a fan of the meme culture and I don't think this is the appropriate place to post it, thank you. https://twitter.com/elonmusk Tesla Inc. 3500 Deer Creek rd.
