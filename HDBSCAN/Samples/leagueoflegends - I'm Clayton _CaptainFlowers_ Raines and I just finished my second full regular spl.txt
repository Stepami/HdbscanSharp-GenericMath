I'm Clayton "CaptainFlowers" Raines and I just finished my second full regular split as a professional caster with the NA LCS; AMA!
Hey everyone, I've been asked multiple times about doing one of these since I became a professional shoutcaster earlier this year and now seemed like the best time to do it. This time last year I was casting whatever I could from my bedroom and this year I got to cast alongside Kobe and Azael at the TD Garden in Boston for the NA LCS 3rd Place Match. (Lolesports just released a photo-diary that I worked on with the team if you'd like a more personal look into that specific experience too!) I'll be hanging out for a while answering as many questions as I can. If your question doesn't get answered, it's probably already been answered or is asking sensitive (secret) info that I can't share. EDIT: I forgot to include the link for the lolesports piece about Boston: http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/arena-captains-log :D EDIT 2: Thanks for all the questions everyone! I've been answering them for about 5 hours now, so I'm going to call it a wrap and go get some food. If I didn't answer your question explicitly, it's worth it to ctrl+f one or two of the key words and see if someone else asked it first and I answered them. See you all around!  submitted by /u/CaptainFlowers22 [link] [comments]
