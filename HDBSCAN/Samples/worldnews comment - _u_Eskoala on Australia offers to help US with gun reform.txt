/u/Eskoala on Australia offers to help US with gun reform
Thanks. It's just a hard situation to get my head around from a country where practically nobody has a gun, and thus nobody needs a gun for defence, but it may be that the genie is out of the bottle in the US. Having a baseball bat under the bed is about as far as it gets generally here (despite the lack of enthusiasm for actual baseball)! These killing sprees are very prominent but they are a small proportion of gun deaths, however they also just don't really happen in other countries, so something about availability and attitude is different. I compare with binge drinking in the UK - alcohol is actually more accessible in mainland Europe but there's less binge drinking because it's a cultural difference, not an availability problem. Perhaps more useful would be reducing the publicity that surrounds these shootings because that seems a big part of why people want to go out this way vs just jumping off a bridge or whatever. I don't think I'll ever quite understand US gun culture - I appreciate owning and using a gun can be fun, actually, but the idea I'm personally responsible for home defense is more terrifying than empowering. I'd rather live somewhere nobody is likely to storm my house than somewhere that permits me a nice rifle to defend myself when they do. The constitutional argument is even more inexplicable because I have no reverence for the constitution of a country I'm not in or from, of course. So I'm kind of just looking for what would make the US safer without destroying a whole cultural thing to which I can't really relate but am trying to fathom. It's interesting that losing some home defense options isn't worth the gain of fewer murder spree mass shootings, I would have thought that would be worth it.
