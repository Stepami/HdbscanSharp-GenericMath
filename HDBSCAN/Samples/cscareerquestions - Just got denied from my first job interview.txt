Just got denied from my first job interview
I just had my first full time job interview on campus on Friday and the interviewer told me he thought I was a really great candidate after I thanked him for the opportunity to interview. Then 2 days later I get an email saying they want to pursue other candidates but gave no other explanation (it seemed like an automated email). I’m feeling really worthless now over it as I got my hopes up since it seemed like it went really well and he praised my skills. Now I’m concerned about even getting a job because failure does that to you. Need some reassurance. Senior CS BA student with a 3.75 GPA from a state university, will have a year of internship experience once I graduate, in a CS honor society, VP of CS club, also a woman if that helps my credentials?  submitted by /u/DefectiveDugong [link] [comments]
