TIL the Israeli forces built the Bar Lev Line on the Suez Canal, costing $300 million and was expected to be a "graveyard for Egyptian troops", as it would take at least 24-48 hours to be breached. On 6 October 1973, armed with a few 100 water cannons, the Egyptians breached it in less than 2 hours.
