/u/Little_Creek on ‘Here we are again’: Australian media exasperated by America’s lack of action on gun control. The country has also suffered deadly mass shootings, but unlike America, it has enacted concrete legislation to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
But even if it were so, you're cherrypicking a single US state against a nation.  Why does it matter that it's a state? Why does that magically make the fact that they have a lower murder rate than half of europe "Bullshit"? Because it doesn't suit your narrative? Because it offends your sensibilities? The fact of the matter is that guns in Vermont and New Hampshire are virtually unregulated yet according to people like you that should lead to rampant gun crime... yet they doesn't happen. If Comparing New Hampshire and Australia is "Cherrypicking" then so is comparing Australia and America.
