[MAIN SPOILERS] Margaery and Lady Olenna....
Okay, maybe this was obvious to everyone else, but I'm watching for a third time with a friend when I noticed this. When Lady Olenna is telling Margaery that she helped kill Joffrey, it shows her grabbing Margaery's necklace and playing with it. I guess the first time around I didn't realize that Olenna grabs the poison off Sansa's necklace, so I didn't notice how they put it right in front of your face!!  submitted by /u/legolana [link] [comments]
