/u/LunaQ on Say no to Electron! Building a fast, responsive desktop app using JavaFX
Well, for one thing I'd know that GPU accelerated graphics isn't really neccessary for this type of system. So, I would not worry about that, I think. Also, you get it for free, so it does not actually add to your development time. As for the editor, I think I'd probably just use a Rich Text editor. If deemed non-sufficient, I'd look into the possibility of using a full blown browser component, similarly to the way that you have done. Again, though, the full blown browser capability is something that you get for free, so it does not actually add much to your development time either. It'd add more to mine, in Delphi, since I'd have to interface against the browser component using COM. As for the database, it's not really a critical part of the system. It could be any file based local database, I think, including a small local Access database file, if that's what you've got. Personally, though, since the application is so simple, I'd probably at least consider implementing it without a database, just storing the data as files on the local file system. It loses one dependency... and it could be worth it in this case, I think.
