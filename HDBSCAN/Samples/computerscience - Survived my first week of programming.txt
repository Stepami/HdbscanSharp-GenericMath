Survived my first week of programming
No question, just want to share happy news and maybe some encouragement for anyone who might be in my spot some day. I just started my second year as a CS major but so far have mainly focused on math, science, and intro CS classes. I’m getting into the more serious classes now and finished my first week of C++ with almost no programming experience. I know it’s just one week, but small victories feel good too. I read every word of the assigned reading, viewed every slide, watched every lecture, and worked through almost every example from the book. (Recommendation to beginner’s: Read every word! Everything matters.) We started with 2 simple programs, which gave me some trouble, but I finally finished them earlier today. The experience was frustrating but very very satisfying. I’m feeling pretty good about my classes. Thanks to everyone who’s answered my previous CS questions. And special thanks to the user who helped me with discrete math. Have a good night everyone.  submitted by /u/zemorah [link] [comments]
