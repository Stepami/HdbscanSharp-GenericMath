Sorry for the noob question but what is the correct terminology for setting up a "contact us" form on the webpage and are there any free services that connect said form to my email?
Im trying to set up a simple website for a service and would like to add a contact us form. I dont have any server or javascript knowledge so I think relying on a free service might be the most efficient route for now I found something like this http://www.freecontactform.com/email_form.php Is this acceptable? I was hoping this community of experts can lend some knowledge THanks~  submitted by /u/Westrivers [link] [comments]
