[AMA Request] Dennis Rodman
What are your feelings about the current situation in North Korea?  What do you spend your time doing when you're over there?  Did you have to promise Kim that you wouldn't release any private information to the public?  How did you originally meet Kim Jong Un?  Have you been contacted by the US government to supply information that could help? (@dennisrodman): https://twitter.com/dennisrodman?s=09    submitted by /u/Idknotcreative [link] [comments]
