[R] Gender Recognition using Gil Levi's Caffe model in a Live Camera Preview - speed problems and asking for possible optimizations in both OpenCV and the model itself
As of now, I've managed to use Gil Levi's Caffe model for Gender Recognition in OpenCV. Basically using said model with Dnn.readNetFromCaffe(). My problem is that processing one frame takes 1.6-1.7 seconds, basically unusable in a live camera preview. So, which do I optimize, OpenCV (especially its tiny-dnn) itself, or the model? And how? Do I also have to implement face tracking and face ID-ing?  submitted by /u/FantasyBorderline [link] [comments]
