/u/TheBlackCentipede on What's the stance on using the "metaprogramming" stuff (such as Reflection)? When is it considered like dirty code? When is it not?
It's sometime acceptable, but I would seriously advocate for documenting why would you use reflection for this particular problem. I use Meta-programming sometime when I'm working against the clock, for an example, instead of typing out query for each member of a class (some of those are 400+ members written by co-workers), I would simply grab a collection of properties for a class and query each one in a tiny snippet of code as opposed to making repeated calls.
