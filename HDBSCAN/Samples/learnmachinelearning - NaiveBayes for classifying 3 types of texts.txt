NaiveBayes for classifying 3 types of texts
Hey, guys! I've started playing with Python and ML, but I have got a problem. I'm trying to train NaiveBayes with 3 kinds of twitter posts. Posts talking about that somebody is sick, somebody is recovered (healthy) and neutral (like wow or something out of health subject) I've achieved pretty satisfying accuracy for classifying posts talking about illness, but I've still got a problem with spotting healthy & neutral posts. I've got about 1k posts for each kind and using ~95% for learning and ~5% for testing. Any tips or ideas for me? :) Everything starts in main.py, training process in naiveBayes.py file https://github.com/jpomykala/TwitterHealth-NLP/tree/master/src I've got an experience with other languages but this is my first time with python, so it can be messy.  submitted by /u/kubelke [link] [comments]
