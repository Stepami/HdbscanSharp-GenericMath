/u/MissTheWire on Harvey Weinstein Lawyers Battling N.Y. Times, New Yorker Over Potentially Explosive Stories
from Hollywood Reporter 2 years ago by someone who made a documentary about Weinstein. I guess The NY Times is no longer afraid? Even after this knockdown, I was still in the ring. IFC had refused to run my film in its New York theater. I called up the director of film studies at New York University. "How would you like to screen the Harvey Weinstein film that everyone's talking about and that nobody has seen? I'll come with great stories about the making of this film and show an uncensored cut." He was enthusiastic. "I'd like to open the screening up to the public," I told him, "so I'm taking an ad in The New York Times." He liked that even more. As it turned out, of course, the Times refused my ad because, I believe, they were afraid of pissing off Harvey, who placed a lot of ads for his films in the Times. As he once reportedly bragged to the media, "I'm the fâ€”ing sheriff of New York!" I called the Times editorial division and told them that their ad department had turned me down. I essentially embarrassed the Times into taking my ad after all. IFC was furious.
