In high school. There was this one girl. I prayed to go that if I was ever going to get laid, all I wanted to do was go down on some chick. She didn't have to say thanks or return the favor. I would even pay. Too bad that she was the son of a narcos girlfriend. Dude was cool. He sold tortas. But you just dont fuck with those people.
