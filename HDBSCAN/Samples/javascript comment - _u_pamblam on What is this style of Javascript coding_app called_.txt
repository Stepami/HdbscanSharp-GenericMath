/u/pamblam on What is this style of Javascript coding/app called?
sure. take a peek at this project i'm working on: https://github.com/Pamblam/jSQL The main js file is defined like this:  jSQL = (function(){ // lots of variables and functions return { // object properties }; })();  that way if i wanna have a variable calledmyVariable inside my jSQL plugin i don't have to worry about there being another variable called myVariable somewhere else in the script. find a tutorial on scope in javascript for more information. or if you wanted an example of how you would use your changer function, it's the same, just without the new.  var changer = caseChanger(); console.log(changer.lc('hELLo wOrLd')); console.log(changer.uc('hELLo wOrLd'));  or if you wanna use the new, you could do something like this  function caseChanger(){ this.lc = function(str){return str.toLowerCase();}; this.uc = function(str){return str.toUpperCase();}; } var changer = new caseChanger; console.log(changer.lc('hELLo wOrLd')); console.log(changer.uc('hELLo wOrLd'));  however, if you're making constructors you're better off using the prototype so you're not defining the same methods over and over for ever instance you create:  function caseChanger(){}; caseChange.prototype.lc = function(str){return str.toLowerCase();}; caseChange.prototype.uc = function(str){return str.toUpperCase();}; var changer = new caseChanger; console.log(changer.lc('hELLo wOrLd')); console.log(changer.uc('hELLo wOrLd'));  but again, you're not constructing anything, so in this case, anything that uses new to construct an object is pointless.
