Why is "Chinatown" considered to have the best screenplay ever?
So I watched Chinatown (dir. by Roman Polanski) today with my family. We all agreed it was an amazing film, compelling and well paced. I have no doubt it has a great screenplay (especially compared to today's standards), but I was wondering, what warrants the title "best screenplay"? I'm not saying its bad, i'm just curious as to what made it good. Coming from someone extremely interested in the writing process of fiction.  submitted by /u/bryin [link] [comments]
