/u/jfoxshakes on Antigua and Barbuda PM reports 90% of Barbuda's structures have been "Totally Demolished"
PHalfpipe, I'm not a denier. You don't need to send me a temp graph I've seen a thousand times and believe in completely. I'm just saying that when we scream "global warming!" BECAUSE we're seeing a lot of hurricanes one season, what happens next year when there are none? I hope you get this. The other category 5 hurricanes that hit land were in 1935, 1969, and 1992. This is not the first.
