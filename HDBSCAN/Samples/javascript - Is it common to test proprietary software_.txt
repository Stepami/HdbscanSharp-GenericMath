Is it common to test proprietary software?
I've been working my first tech job at a bank for the last few months, and we've been spending a lot of time on projects where we write tests for proprietary software that the company uses. For example, one of my coworkers has been writing tests for some Oracle application that we use to detect fraudulent activity. It personally doesn't make sense to me to pay for software that should already be thoroughly tested by the creator and write tests for it as well. If it breaks that often we shouldn't be buying it. It doesn't seem to be common elsewhere. Does anyone else's company do this?  submitted by /u/AltrdFate [link] [comments]
