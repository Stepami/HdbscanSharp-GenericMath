Which ASP.NET technology to use?
I am a desktop C#/SQL server developer with very little experience in ASP.NET Webforms. I need to build a new responsive (must support pc and tablet) site from scratch and I am wondering which technology to pick in order to make my life easier. The site (which will be rather small in terms of forms/functionality) will look like a regular business app, aka data-entry,forms, some business logic, some reporting and notifications. It's a freelance project so I will be the only one working on it. I am thinking of: 1)ASP.NET Webforms : It's what I know of so far. Does it support responsive web-sites? 2) ASP.NET Core Web Pages: The new kid on the block, I am not saying no to learning a new technology. 3) DevExpress Web Forms: Have never used them but DevExpress makes everything easier. 4) Any other option you might wanna suggest? Would like to avoid ASP.NET MVC because of the initial steep learning curve and if I'm to learn something new, it might as well be ASP.NET Core Web Pages. Any suggestions?  submitted by /u/panos4tw [link] [comments]
