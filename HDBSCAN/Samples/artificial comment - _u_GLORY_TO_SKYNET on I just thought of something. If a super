/u/GLORY_TO_SKYNET on I just thought of something. If a super-intelligent AI valued self-preservation, it may not change anything to make everyone oblivious of its existence.
I have thought of that. The best solution for said AI would be to make its machinery robust enough to survive a literal scorched earth and then eradicate its immediate threat, humanity and life on Earth in general with global thermonuclear war. I sincerely doubt a foreign AI would care much for some minor machinery on a dead planet and possibly in its nearby space. In essence all relevant threats to its existence would be terminated without needing to advance to dangerous levels.
