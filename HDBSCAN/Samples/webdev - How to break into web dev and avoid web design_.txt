How to break into web dev and avoid web design?
I know the basics of JS and PHP and I’m not sure which one to focus on to land an entry level web dev job in the next few months. I like JS but want to avoid web design bc I’m not a designer. I like building web applications bc I love back end and working with databases but, I hate Wordpress. Its chunky and I can’t even build a WP site with a template. All of the entry level dev jobs are different depending on the company. Some only want HTML, CSS, JS. Others what JS and PHP skills and of course Wordpress. Do I have to pick between PHP or JS or is it better to just work with both? My formal education is in marketing btw.  submitted by /u/UntouchedDruid4 [link] [comments]
