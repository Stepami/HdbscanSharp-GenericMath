Hello Everyone! I'm a 25 year old DACA recipient who self deported back in February. I moved to the US at 4 months old,lived there for 4 years and then moved back to Venezuela. After Chavez got elected in 1998 life in Venezuela became really difficult and my family decided to move back to the US. I'm here to answer any questions about DACA and my journey to my new home in Europe. My Proof: https://imgur.com/9iYT6Mf  submitted by /u/DreamerAlways [link] [comments]
