/u/Dementati on Agile Software Development and Scrum - Heaven or Hell?
See, you're contradicting yourself here and backing my point :) You can never put a number on something even approximately true? That's a realllly bad estimate. It's something that needs a lot of repeating, and measure, to align.  Nah man. :) Another explanation that fits with the evidence is that it just doesn't work. How are you tracking these knowledges year on year, across aggregate teams, across projects, customers, and domains? How are you quantifying the effect of developing faster across projects?  Ain't nobody got time for that. That is barely defensible for single teams and small projects. It's is insanity in the Enterprise.  My employer has been doing quite well for over 20 years and is now doing better than ever, so no worries, mate. So back to the "for realsies" bit: we have studied gut feelings extensively. They don't work like you presume here.  Except that I'm not really presuming anything. We have been consistently on schedule every single sprint for two years with virtually no overtime whatsoever. For whatever reason, it does work.
