/u/fahdadatin on Navid Negahban Cast As The Sultan In Disney’s ‘Aladdin’ Remake
Well to set your paranoia straight, no that doesn't make YOU a racist for recognizing an actor who has played a TV terrorist. Nor does that change Negahban's personality for playing a fictional character. It's jus a shitty situation to be in as an actor who wants work and your agent keeps putting "Terrorist Number 10" casting calls in your email.
