/u/steauengeglase on South Carolina prison overtaken by inmates, currently on facility roof
Still sucks (for everyone). When my dad worked there 10 years ago when SCDC had a riot or some major event at one prison, every prison went into lock down. The inmates have to be counted every hour on the hour (no sleep) without the usual privileges and guards are going to be staying at work for at least the next 24 to 48 hours (again, no sleep). It screws life up for everyone.
