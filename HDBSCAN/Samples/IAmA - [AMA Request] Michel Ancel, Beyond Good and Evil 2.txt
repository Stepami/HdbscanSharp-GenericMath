[AMA Request] Michel Ancel, Beyond Good and Evil 2
My 5 Questions: How much creative freedom did you have?  What advise would you give to game designers to make indie-style games for big companies like Ubisoft, EA, etc?  How much has the video game industry changed from your perspective since the original Rayman and Beyond Good and Evil 2?  How do you add so many elements to your games and still make them feel cohesive?  How did you get Beyond Good and Evil 2 greenlit?
