Problems with classic freelancing model
What are the main problems we all see with the classic freelancing model? Price? Difficulty of securing work? Reliability of work and/or client?  How often do you feel that you are unable to complete a whole job by yourself? I am interested in looking at how freelance designers can work together on the same project.  submitted by /u/lifeinparts [link] [comments]
