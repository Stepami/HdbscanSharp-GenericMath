[D] Applying CNNs to spatial/geographic data
I'm working on a project where I want to predict whether a geographic area is likely to observe a particular effect I'm studying. For inputs, I have multiple layers of US Census variables which have been rasterized into 10x10mi squares. My targets are the same format. Not all areas exhibit the effect so I'm only training based on cells where there has been an observed value and using that to predict the rates for the other cells. I've initially tried flattening the entire set so that each cell becomes a pair of independent inputs-target values and using a standard fully connected network. Results seem pretty good. Practically speaking, there is some non-zero chance of it occurring everywhere so I think this approach works. But that had me thinking that there's definitely a neighboring component to this problem since we are talking about people and geography. Convolutions seem like a good idea to grab neighboring cells while handling the depth (features) too. But I'm having a hard time thinking how it could practically be applied. There's only one United States to train on. Maybe grab patches and train that way, but then how do I handle those with no observed effect? Wondering if anyone has applied CNNs in practice against geographic data?  submitted by /u/ElPresidente408 [link] [comments]
