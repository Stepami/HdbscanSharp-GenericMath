Using Azure REST API to Implement Solutions for Azure Stack
Hi, everyone. At the company I work we develop an application that manages cloud resources for multiple providers. Using this platform users can create and manage VMs at AWS, Azure or Google using the same interface. The next thing on our roadmap is to implement a solution for Azure Stack, so users can manage their cloud resource and on-premises resources all together. The problem is that I was not given any sandbox environment to develop and/or test this feature (sigh). According to my researches, Azure Stack is practically the same thing as Azure for usability and features. So I assumed that we can work with Azure APIs on Azure Stack. Probably by just switching the Azure domain for the on-premise Stack domain. My questions are: Does anybody knows if we can really use Azure APIs on Azure Stack environments?  If we can do this. How we can do it? We just made the same calls we do on Azure and switches the “management.azure.com” with our domain?  Are there any way I can get a sandbox access for Azure Stack for free? According to this link, we can set a policy to simulate an Azure subscription to be treated like Azure Stack but I couldn’t figure out if this would be enough for me.    submitted by /u/loochez [link] [comments]
