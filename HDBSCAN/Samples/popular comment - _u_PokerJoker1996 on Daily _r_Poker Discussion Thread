What are the hand ranges of a REG in the below in percentages: Someone told me that it was somewhere between 15-30% Ranges from a hand range chart to be the most profitable. (even though I'm just playing free chips at WSOP poker) I have difficulties trying to find resources about the exact percentage ranges. 6max TAG 9max TAG 6max LAG 9max LAG please kindly answer all 4 of those above! thanks! =)
