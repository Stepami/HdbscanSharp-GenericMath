[D] A good list of conferences and their deadlines?
Hi r/machinelearning, Does anyone have a good list of high quality conferences and their schedules (deadlines and so on)? I've seen sites like this before for things like CV and security, but is there a more general one out there, or one for machine learning that filters out the noise?
