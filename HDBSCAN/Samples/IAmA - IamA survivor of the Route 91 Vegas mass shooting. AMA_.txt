IamA survivor of the Route 91 Vegas mass shooting. AMA...
My short bio: I wrote down my experience Tuesday morning to capture the details while they were still vivid and fresh. https://imgur.com/gallery/KKfSp A lot of friends and strangers, both those whom were there and those who weren't said that it helped them in different ways. We're all going to deal with this in our own ways. So far, I've felt that it's tough to talk about or write down, but afterwards I feel slightly less terrible. Sitting in my Woodland Hills apartment while my girlfriend Jamie is sleeping. Not doing much to spend my time right now, so I figured I'd try and have a discussion. Hoping this may help with the mental health process, as well as potentially help others.
