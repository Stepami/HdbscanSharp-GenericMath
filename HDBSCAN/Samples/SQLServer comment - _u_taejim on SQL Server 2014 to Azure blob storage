/u/taejim on SQL Server 2014 to Azure blob storage - Picking up new databases
You're welcome - it gave me an excuse to get around to trying backup-to-blob, and I noticed the documentation wasn't great. It's been about 2 years since I've had to worry about backing up databases (I'm no longer primarily a DBA, and most of the databases I still support are on Azure SQL DB and don't need me to back them up), and yes, Minion does seem to have become quite popular. I've been on the Ola Hallengren train since the beginning though, and haven't quite gotten around to trying the Minion scripts. They could well be better in this situation than Ola's, and it's possible that they may also detect the new databases that were restored on the server (not created on the server). One other tip - once you've backed up to Azure, make sure you can restore from it as well, both on your production server and onto other servers. There's no point backing databases up if you can't restore them :) This is especially important if you have hundreds of databases - what will be the process to find the latest full backup and differential backup file (you need both backups to restore), and restore them? 100 databases means at least 200 restore commands. Also, I had @Verify = 'N' as part of my backup. You might want to change that to a 'Y'. This will validate that the backup file is OK without actually restoring the database. It doubles the amount of time to run the backups, but gives you extra assurance.
