The Rich Husband
A cell phone on a bench in the locker room of a gym rang and the man next to it put it on speaker, so everybody could hear. Everybody immediately stopped talking to listen in on the conversation. WOMAN - "Hello?" MAN - "Hello." WOMAN - "Hi, honey, are you at the club?" MAN - "Yes." WOMAN - "I've been shopping around and found a beautiful leather coat, and it only costs $2000. Can I get it?" MAN - "If you really like it, sure." WOMAN - "I also stopped by the car dealership, and there's a new model that I really like." MAN - "How much is it?" WOMAN - "$90,000" MAN - "Sure, get it, but for that price, I want all options." WOMAN - "Great, and one last thing." MAN - "What is it?" WOMAN - "I was talking to Sarah a couple hours ago, and the house I really wanted to get two years ago is back on the market now." MAN - "How much is it?" WOMAN - "It's $980,000." MAN - "Alright, offer $900,000. They'll probably take it. If not, another $80,000 is worth it if you really like it." WOMAN - "Okay, I'll see you later! I love you so much!" MAN - "Bye, I love you too." The man then hung up. The other men in the locker room were looking at him with surprised faces. The man looked at them and said "Anybody know whose phone this is?"
