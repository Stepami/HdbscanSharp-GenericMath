I was made with donated sperm AMA!
I have always known that I was created by artificial insemination from an anonymous donor. I have a mom and a dad, plus two siblings. Most stories in the news support the narrative, that "kids" like me are "missing something". I find it stigmatizing. I am hoping to change this. So ask me anything! Facts: I am 28. I live in Denmark. I am biologically related to my mom, and not to my dad. Yes. I call him dad :-) I have made a couple of appearances on TV, radio etc. in Denmark, but I am often told, that a happy donor child is not interesting enough for TV. This is my first English project, but here are some Danish ones (proof): http://www.andreasnilsson.dk/donorbarn/index.php/Hanna.html http://politiken.dk/debat/art5438293/Det-er-ikke-synd-for-mig http://www.dr.dk/radio/p1/p1-debat/p1-debat-2016-10-28  submitted by /u/hannella [link] [comments]
