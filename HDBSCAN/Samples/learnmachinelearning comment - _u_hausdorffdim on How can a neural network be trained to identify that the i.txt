/u/hausdorffdim on How can a neural network be trained to identify that the input belongs to none of the trained labels?
Ok. My other proposed solution would be: I suppose you have an output that gives probabilities of each class like the softmax function. Typically you choose the label based on choosing the label that gave the highest probability... I would construct an if statement that analyzes that if the probability isn't strong enough then it belongs to neither class. Like if your output probability vector is [0.49, 0.51] then choosing label 2 isn't really appropriate and the correct answer is that this is just noise.
