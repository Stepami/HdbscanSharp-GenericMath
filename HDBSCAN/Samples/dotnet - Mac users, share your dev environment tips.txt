Mac users, share your dev environment tips
I have switched over to mac, first time, my main focus is and always has been dotnet core backend development. On windows I had the nice gamut of Visual Studio Pro, PoshGit (used with Gitkraken) and Postman. I would like to know what cool workflow improvements I can make to my vanilla out of the box expirience. I am also currently testing out Visual Studio Community for mac vs JetBrains Ryder. What IDE do you think I should use? or should I use VS Code? I am semi comfortable with VS Code. Thanks :)  submitted by /u/crazymonkey159 [link] [comments]
