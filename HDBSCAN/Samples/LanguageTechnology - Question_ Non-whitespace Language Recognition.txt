Question: Non-whitespace Language Recognition
Hello everyone, I would like to know if there are any established methods for determining whether a collection of characters is a sentence in natural language, but with whitespace removed. That is, if we had the sentence: "thisisasentenceinenglish" This would be recognised as natural language, however the sentence: "strinimaaluxtosoripo" Would not (even though it might exhibit patterns of a natural language). I only need the algorithm to recognise English. I have thought of ways to do this using a dictionary, but my idea is essentially to interleave whitespace back into the string constructively. This would essentially entail adding spaces around the longest collections of characters that map to English words in a dictionary. This might, however, require backtracking, and seems like an inefficient/inelegant solution in general. This obviously would not scale well with the length of the string. But is this as good as we can do? Thanks in advance for any help!  submitted by /u/TheUndead96 [link] [comments]
