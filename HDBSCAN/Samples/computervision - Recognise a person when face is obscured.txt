Recognise a person when face is obscured
I'm trying to help people pick out their photos from large albums (on our service) quickly. I tried using AWS Rekognition's SearchFaces API to index all the photos of an album and then search for a person's face (once they choose one or two photos of theirs). But 80% of our photos do not have the face in a perfect non-obscured manner. Instead they are side poses, people with head-gear, eye-gear etc. I've turned my effort towards figuring out a way to use the entire human body of the person for performing recognition... So once a person identifies themselves... I want to be able to search through the entire photo-set to find photos that contain this person (using face, clothes, body-shape, hair, etc). Very new to CV / MachineLearning. Hoping to find an algorithm or a library that does this already. Thanks :) :)  submitted by /u/Steverob91 [link] [comments]
