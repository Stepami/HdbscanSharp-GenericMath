/u/swish-t on Russell Westbrook is coming
it IS me man. That comment is basically admitting that I commented to my own video with "cool video tho". I am Stefan from youtube/heatcheck. Reddit blocked my account here cause I "self promoted" And what ended up happening is the video blowing up on reddit without anyone knowing who did it or how to subscribe to the person that made it. Not cool....Anyway, you can think that I am deceiving him or whatever. As long as that channel gets the proper credit. aka- my channel. smh...
