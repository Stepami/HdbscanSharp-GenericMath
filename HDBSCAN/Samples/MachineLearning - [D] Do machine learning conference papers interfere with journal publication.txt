[D] Do machine learning conference papers interfere with journal publication
I am a biologist interested in submitting my work to ICLR, which requires an 8-pg paper. Will this interfere with submission of the same work to a traditional biology journal? The workshop track asks for a 3-page abstract. I assume this would not interfere? Thanks!  submitted by /u/timburg [link] [comments]
