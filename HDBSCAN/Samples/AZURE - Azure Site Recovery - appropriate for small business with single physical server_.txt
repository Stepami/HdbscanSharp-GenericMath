Azure Site Recovery - appropriate for small business with single physical server?
I'm looking at the single physical (2008R2!) server that I have responsibility for, and really need a better DR situation This roles of this server are: AD file serving SQL Server custom applications using SQL Server  The latter two of which I am planning on moving to Azure PaaS-based solutions (Azure SQL and App Service, with IaaS VMs where necessary). But I still want DR coverage for the AD and file serving roles of this machine - and SQL Server and the custom apps until we have done the necessary lift-and-shift. But looking at ASR it appears there is a need for a configuration server and process server roles. Can I run all roles related to ASR on the same machine that is protected by ASR? I know this might not be best practice, but is it doable if I accept certain constraints (whatever they may be). I'm aware that it is not possible to failback from ASR VM's to a physical VM - that is a constraint that I am happy to accept (will probably set failback procedure as having some downtime to do a backup of the ASR VM to a separate backup service we use, and then restore to the physical when it is available again).  submitted by /u/jimmcslim [link] [comments]
