/u/DothrakAndRoll on 14 year old you is shown is a picture of current you, how do they react?
I am 30 and I get this. I did the same thing when I was 25-29 or so. I hit a point somewhere in the last couple years where I realized that you never hit a point where you "grow up" and all of a sudden you're an adult. You just slowly figure things out and try and improve yourself in small ways to enjoy life. You slowly learn through experience, friendships, relationships and other connections and make better decisions based on those experiences. In the past 10 years I've learned about nutrition, diet, exercise, music, relationships and so much more. I'm at a point now where I exercise regularly, eat healthy, play the drums pretty well and have an extensive music collection. I'm still learning self control with money but I have a plan to be out of debt in a year. Then I think I'll start saving for a down payment on a house. I've had a good steady job for many years but don't want it to be my career, so that's another big one I have to work on. My point is, you shouldn't (if you are) be stressing out about growing up or being more of an adult. I wish someone had told me that no one ever really "grows up," we just keep growing until we die and try not to fuck up too bad along the way.
