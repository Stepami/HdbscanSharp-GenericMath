/u/Isolated_Aura on [NO SPOILERS] My new tattoo of Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion!
Yeah, I definitely like that people who are not fans of the show/books (or even those who are, but do not catch what I was going for) can hopefully appreciate the tattoos, simply for being cool looking dragons. And I agree... we'll likely at least have a Viserion/Drogon battle. Which, I'm sure will look great but end sadly. Poor Dany :( It is my first tattoo! There certainly were a few people in my life who were somewhat shocked but I am happy with it. I did consider putting them in a less visible location, or even starting with just one of the dragons and seeing how I felt with it. Ultimately though, I knew I wanted all three of them, so I decided just to go for it!
