/u/Bassline05 on Winner sues Colorado lottery for millions over fixed jackpot
I see your point. I don't think there is any clear cut answer. I think you are right in that we need more free thinkers. We also need to encourage people to think for themselves and not for tests. I only take tests when I am starting a new job, and usually they are personality tests. Those are even rare. My girlfriend, not to bring her up again, volunteers her time teaching underserved kids SAT skills. She tells me that she encourages questions, and wants kids to succeed. She is SMART, like was on jeopardy smart. She also tells horror stories about kids who can't read in high school because they were encouraged to sit back while the teachers didn't give a shit. I was raised by an educator, my mother, and I am the only kid in my family to graduate high school. I wish there was a magic bullet so to speak, but I also hope that I am a part of the solution and not the problem.
