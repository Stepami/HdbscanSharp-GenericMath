Thank you for your submission to /r/NotTheOnion! Your submission has been automatically removed since your submission's title appears to be different from the headline of the article you submitted. Submissions with altered titles are not permitted, all titles must be the headline from the article, copy-and-pasted. Please read the information below before modmailing us. We will not answer your modmail if your issue was addressed below. Do not add periods or quotation marks to the title.  Do not use the suggest title button. Instead, copy-and-paste the article's title directly from the link you are submitting.  Make sure your source doesn't have a paywall. Because of the method used to check titles, submissions from sites that have paywalls may be removed since the bot cannot access the article. If your source does have a paywall, you can resubmit from an alternative source that is not behind a paywall.   You may resubmit with the correct title, but remember that our other rules must be followed as well. For more information on our rules, check out /r/NotTheOnion/w/NTO101. I'm a bot, and this action was performed automagically.
