How much math is needed to really grok Machine Learning?
Hey! I want to learn Machine Learning and integrate it into my career. What kind of math background is required to really comprehend the research? Unfortunately my background has always been a bit light, and I fear I may have to go back and do some legwork before I can even start with the basics.  submitted by /u/baordog [link] [comments]
