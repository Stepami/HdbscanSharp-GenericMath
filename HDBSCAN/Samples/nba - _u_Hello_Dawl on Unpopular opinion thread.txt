You still lost man hours. And idk why you guys hate CoJo, unless he's fallen off this year he's been a decent backup PG. Carrol was obviously shit, but Patterson, Tucker, and COJO are still dudes that made you one of the deepest teams in the league. Lowry+Bench was a deadly lineup because of this. I'm not saying you're bench is ass now, it's just a question mark, something that isn't typically the case. And I'm not talking about Ibaka/Ross since that happened early in the season.
