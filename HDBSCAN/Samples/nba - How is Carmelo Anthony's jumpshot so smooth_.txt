How is Carmelo Anthony's jumpshot so smooth?
I'm watching the videos of him and other NBA players in those pick-up games, and jesus christ. Every shot in the video is just pure wet, at least almost shot was wet. It's like all he needs is the flick of the wrist. Magical shit dog  submitted by /u/calm5 [link] [comments]
