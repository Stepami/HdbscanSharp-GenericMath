American Vandal may be the most overlooked series of the year
I haven't heard many people talking about Netflix's series American Vandal but I finally got around to watching it, and it actually blew me away from start to finish. I think it may have been overlooked because of it's extremely sophomoric premise, but in reality it is a very poignant commentary on a lot of problems with American society. It does all this in the way only a comedy can. It may not seem like this in the first few episodes, but it's gradual climb from satire to social criticism, and it is handled perfectly. I strongly urge people to give this a try if you haven't already. It is one of the most satisfying watches from start to finish I've seen in a while. It's also only around four hours of television, so it's an easy watch. Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3tkFOtM6go  submitted by /u/ArryPotta [link] [comments]
