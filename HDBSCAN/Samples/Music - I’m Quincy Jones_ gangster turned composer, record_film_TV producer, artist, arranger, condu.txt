I’m Quincy Jones: gangster turned composer, record/film/TV producer, artist, arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, record co. exec., TV station owner, magazine founder, entrepreneur, humanitarian, and the dude who holds the record for most Grammy noms (79) and as many wins (27) as anyone alive. AMA!
As one of only 17 EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) holders in history, the producer of Michael Jackson’s Thriller (best-selling album of all-time), Bad, and Off the Wall, Frank Sinatra’s conductor/arranger/producer, and an individual who had the pleasure of calling Ray Charles a best friend, I’ve picked up a lot of stories on the way and would love to share them with you. Ask me anything! Proof: https://twitter.com/QuincyDJones/status/915285484313522176 I’ll be answering your questions at 6PM PST today 10.4.17! See y’awl then!  submitted by /u/QuincyDJones [link] [comments]
