Does everybody find the modern fullstack learning curve this overwhelming, or is it just me?
So I'm a frontend web dev/designer who decided I want to up my skillset and break out of just designing sites using jQuery and a few other libraries for DOM manipulation. I want to learn everything properly and to feel like I understand what's going on at every level of web applications. So I started taking this course on Udemy. The instructor is excellent, but my god, the breadth of all of this is just overwhelming. It's not so much realizing that there's a lot I don't yet know, but not even knowing how much more I don't know. I'm about halfway through and already feeling like I'll need to go and revisit the early lessons because it's just informational overflow. How does one person become so familiar with this many libraries and tools, and become comfortable enough to wire them all together coherently? Is anyone actually so comfortable with, say, the entire MEAN/MERN stack that they can sit there and just bang out an app prototype in a few hours, or is it a constant pause and reference to documentation and syntax as you build like it is for me? I guess I just feel a bit discouraged. Every time it feels like I've made some significant progress in learning, it seems like there's still an entire ocean to cross.  submitted by /u/sleepinlight [link] [comments]
