I'm Arion and I'm the founder of a thriving feminine care tech startup! Ask me how to pitch for funding & get your brand featured & recognized nationally! (Blank) AMA!
I incorporated my company (Femly) and launched fairly quickly though we experienced a few hurdles in the beginning. Prior to starting the company I was diagnosed with a cervical tumor and thought it wasn't cancerous, my doctor suggested that I make the switch to natural products. At the time I couldn't find any around me so I set out to form my own simple solution and disrupt the feminine-care industry! My Proof: 10 Days after we launched I pitched to investors and started the due-diligence process of accepting a deal of $125K for 25% preferred equity in my company. Watch my pitch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxiGPm3dOBM Despite the deal falling through for a myriad of reasons (mostly investor logistic related) I worked my ass off to gain traction and land the first 350 subscribers! After launching we came across a cybersquatting case, but the company in question was forced to hand over the domain------major win! As a result, we were featured in Affinity Magazine, NowThis News, The Huffington Post, Forbes, The Afro, XoNecole, Slay Culture, Blavity & even did a live segment on Fox45 Baltimore!

I'd love to network, connect and spread the word! Indiegogo: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/support-this-woman-owned-feminine-care-company-women-technology/x/17442630#/ I've won over 5 pitch competitions and $20K in funding since launch and have 7 competitions coming up in Baltimore, MD, Washington,DC, NYC, Silicon Valley and major talks with 3 venture capitalist firms! On facebook, I'm know as the "Pitchqueen" but feel free to ask me about pitching and how I got to where I am!  submitted by /u/PitchQueenofNY [link] [comments]
