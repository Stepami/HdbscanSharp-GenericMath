Calling all web designers!
Hi there, I'm looking for a web designer for my potential new company. The concept is similar to designer clothing brands such as Supreme and Bape but with a twist. I'm hoping for the site to look simple, yet slick and classy. PM me if you're interested for details and we can discuss payment. It would also be great if you sent over a portfolio of your work but this is optional. Thanks!  submitted by /u/01892 [link] [comments]
