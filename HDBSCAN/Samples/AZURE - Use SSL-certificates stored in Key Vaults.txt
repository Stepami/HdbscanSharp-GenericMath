Use SSL-certificates stored in Key Vaults
Is it possible to take an SSL-certificate uploaded as a secret to a Key Vault in Azure, and import it to a webapp using the option "SSL certificates->Import App Service Certificate"? I run a website with around 20 domains, each having a number of webapps, and each webapp is setup to a custom domain in azure. This means that when my star.sertificate expires I have to update a bunch of webapps, causing possible downtime and big annoyance. So what I wanted to do was create a secret in a Key Vault, upload a certificate there, and just import the secret into each webapp. But when I open one webapp, open SSL certificates, and press Import App Service Certificate, I get a message saying: Select certificates to assign to your app. Only certificates in Ready State are available for consumption. No valid certificate found  So maybe I am doing something wrong?  submitted by /u/Torquai [link] [comments]
