/u/llllIlllIllIlI on Candidate for Charlotte mayor puts 'white' among qualifications
Bobshayd explained this already. There are two definitions of racism at okay here and you are using one while those you are arguing against are using another. You - what I call "mental racism" - racism with definition of "person or people think race X has certain traits Y." Opponents - what I call "historical racism" - racism with definition of "historical and hierarchical structure of power in which one group expresses power over another, often based on unscientific ideas of inborn racial traits" A black panther calling a white man a devil is mental racism. A white WASP immediately ignoring a resume because the applicant's name is Tyrone is historical racism. So now we have definitions. And both you and the mod should use them because if you don't then you'll likely be talking about different things and both keep thinking you're winning. Note: I don't believe that the mods example is even mental racism, btw. Without context it is, sure. But in the context of the movie it's not even that. So really you're doubly wrong.
