[AMA Request] Aleksander Doba
My 5 Questions: How did your kayak survive through 25ft waves? (I assume there's a way you can seal everything up) What did you do for food? What happened when you were robbed close to Brazil? What was the scariest thing to happen during any of your three expeditions? What did the solar panels charge?
