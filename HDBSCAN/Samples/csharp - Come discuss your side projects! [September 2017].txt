Come discuss your side projects! [September 2017]
Hello everyone! This is a monthly thread for sharing and discussing side-projects created by /r/csharp's community. Feel free to create standalone threads for your side-projects if you so desire. This thread's goal is simply to spark discussion within our community that otherwise would not exist. Please do check out newer posts and comment on others' projects.
