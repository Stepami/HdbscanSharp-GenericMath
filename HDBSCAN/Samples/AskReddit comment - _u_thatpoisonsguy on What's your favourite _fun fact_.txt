/u/thatpoisonsguy on What's your favourite "fun fact"?
What I am thinking of isn't a gas. Very curious which gas it is that you are talking about though. There's a fair amount of stuff out there that can kill you outright; even diesel fumes are known to sensitize the myocardium and induce arrest in susceptible individuals (generally in enclosed spaces). I was alluding more to substances where even if someone is in hospital, in intensive care, there is nothing someone can do for them.
