Hello Q ! I'm a young 22 years old artist living in France. I'd like to be a professional musician at the highest level but i just don't know how to find my way in the business. And i believe i have what it takes to succeed if a chance comes my way. Can you give me some advice about how i can make it ? I just don't want to give up on that dream, music is what i live for 🙏 I hope you will read my comment 😊 Thanks !
