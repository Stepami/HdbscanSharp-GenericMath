/u/pgmr87 on I can't seem to pass a class into a method that has the base class as the argument
/u/SirSooth is right. For help on a possible solution, can you post your code either via a link or use reddit code formatting to make things easier to understand? I am having trouble understanding what you are ultimately trying to do with the viewmodels. Also, instead of using "BaseA" or "Class1" for examples, you should be more specific. For example:  BaseA => ViewModel BaseB => MemberViewModel Class1 => PrimeMemberViewModel Class2 => RegularMemberViewModel BaseC => ApplicantViewModel Class3 => LoanApplicantViewModel Class4 => MemberApplicantViewModel  I hope that example conveys what I mean.
