/u/restless-rdt on First disconnect in comp
Couple of things. You don't gain less SR if you disconnected during a match. It is still based on your performance. DCing can affect your performance of course, but not so drastically to affect your SR like that. Your hardware or network caused your DC, not Blizzard. If you were still able to connect to the match, the server didn't crash. Honest mistakes happen, but how would an automatic system differentiate between internet dropping and me unplugging my router/modem?
