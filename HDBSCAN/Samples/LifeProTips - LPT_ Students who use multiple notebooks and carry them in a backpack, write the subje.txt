LPT: Students who use multiple notebooks and carry them in a backpack, write the subject name on the top edge of your notebook so you can easily identify which notebook to pull out.
As a highschool student who uses 5 different 70 pg notebooks for 5 different classes, identifying which notebook to pull out at the beginning of class can be a huge pain, sometimes pulling out the 4 others before my targeted notebook. To solve this, simply write the first few letters of the course title on the top spine of your notebook, so when you look into your backpack, you can easily identify which notebook you need to pull out, just by looking at the spine!

Hope this helps some other current students!  submitted by /u/Karrowt [link] [comments]
