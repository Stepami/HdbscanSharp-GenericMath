/u/DoctorOverhard on Interpreted Programming Languages and Why Simpler Isn't Always Better
Do you disagree  It depends. fwiw, I wanted an excuse to try kotlin so here's my results for the original prob (1000000 lines, 1-100000):  import java.io.File fun main(args: Array) { val start=System.currentTimeMillis() val arr = IntArray(100001) File("/tmp/numbers.txt").forEachLine{ arr[it.toInt()]++ } println(arr.indices.maxBy { arr[it] } ?: -1) println(System.currentTimeMillis()-start) } 8143 180   old elite 8200 i5 machine fwiw. It is fairly terse, really fast (180ms), and interops with the jvm like nothing (and has js transpiler). I'm not sure I would put all my eggs in the JS basket. edit more validations:  wc numbers.txt 1000000 1000000 5888501 numbers.txt grep '^8143$' numbers.txt |wc 25 25 125
