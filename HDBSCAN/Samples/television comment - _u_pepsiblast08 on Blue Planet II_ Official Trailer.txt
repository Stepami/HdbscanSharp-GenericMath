/u/pepsiblast08 on Blue Planet II: Official Trailer
For the most part. However, I've tried to get 4k stuff to up and it produced at 1080. Then I had a friend do it with the same settings and it upped at 4k, correctly. I've had it happen a couple times, but can never replicate the issue on a 3rd party. Only happens when upping from my PC. -_-
