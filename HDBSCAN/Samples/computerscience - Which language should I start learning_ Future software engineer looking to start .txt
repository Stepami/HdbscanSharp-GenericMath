Which language should I start learning? Future software engineer looking to start a new career.
About me: 24 years old, Lives between san francisco and san jose. Wants my chances of getting hired to be super high, I would also like to program from home some day as I love to travel. But a long term job is what I'm after first... So, I have zero programming experience . Now my questions are, What would be a good programming language to start learning first? Where would be my best bet at learning it? College?Certification prgm? Online prgm? Reading your book recommendation? I have a lot of free time and a powerful laptop. I would love to start programming for pay in as a little as 3 months if that could be done.  submitted by /u/HonestOpinion650 [link] [comments]
