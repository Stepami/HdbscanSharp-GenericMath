Skirmish on Ch√¢teau Guillard glitched out, turned in to a gorgeous wallpaper!
Here's the beautiful scenery. (Only 1080p, sorry, I've set screenshot scale at 1X.) Edit: Here's the upscaled version using waifu2x. Queud for a FFA and was greeted with this beauty. Somehow remembered the key combo to turn UI off and managed to immortalize this. It's not exactly following the rule of three in photography and it's missing a couple of trees, but I still think it looks very pretty. Makes me hope that Blizz would release these sort of wallpapers for all maps! That Omnic city on the bottom of King's Row looks so badass! Speaking of which; Blizz when do we get an Omnic slums map? Edit: Didn't know which flair would be the most applicable with this post.  submitted by /u/PuntendedInn [link] [comments]
