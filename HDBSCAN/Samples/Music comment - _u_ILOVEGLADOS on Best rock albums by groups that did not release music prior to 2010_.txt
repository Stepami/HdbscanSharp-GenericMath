/u/ILOVEGLADOS on Best rock albums by groups that did not release music prior to 2010?
Can heavily recommend Royal Blood's two albums, particularly their eponymous debut, very much in the Foo Fighters mould. New Politics - Vikings if you like a bit of a pop-edge to your rock. Want It Need It - Baby Strange, up and coming Scottish pop-punk Alpha Male Tea Party, eponymous album, instrumental math(?) rock Rock is Dead - Dorothy, great hard rock album with a female lead vocalist Ghost, all three albums, more metal and very well-known but thought I'd throw them in anyway. Polygon - Battle Tapes, electronic-rock infused, really dig these guys The Amazons, eponymous album. Decent debut, got a really big push in the UK earlier this year The Big Moon - Love in the 4th Dimension, all-girl rock group, pretty good sound, Cupid is one of my favourite songs of 2017 Slaves - Are You Satisifed?, Blisteringly punk-ish I really like Royal Deluxe as well, more of a supergroup who don't have an album yet but a few EPs still. Worth a mention as their blues rock sound is really great.
