I'm Charlie Hamilton James, I'm a wildlife photographer for National Geographic Magazine. Huge fan of vultures and sea otters. Today is World Animal Day so AMA!
Hi my name is Charlie Hamilton James and I’m a National Geographic Magazine photographer. As a kid all I wanted to do was shoot for National Geographic and finally, after a lot of years, I work for them pretty much full time. Many of us who shoot for the magazine specialise in certain areas and subjects. I started out specialising in wildlife then I broadened out to cover other subjects - vultures was my favourite wildlife story. Now I tend to shoot people and animal stories - usually conservation based. I recently finished a story on wildlife poisoning in Africa which is a huge problem and an untold story. It’s pretty depressing stuff but an important story to tell. Currently I’m shooting four stories for the magazine - one on sea otters which I haven’t started yet but can’t wait to get going on - I’m a massive otter fan. Before working as a still photographer, I made wildlife films for the BBC and worked as a wildlife cameraman; but I love shooting stills far more than shooting movies.

Have a great day. I'm taking the doodle out now to check my camera traps. See ya!  submitted by /u/nationalgeographic [link] [comments]
