/u/n_pit on Random Cropping as Data Augmentation?
Simplest thing is to make the network input size same as the crop size. You can crop the images online (after loading into memory) , which is the standard practice given the amount of data. If you crop too much, you risk discarding the defining object of interest in the image. In this case, optimising the crop metaparams would be crucial. If you limit them to a reasonable window though (check the related work, where it is around 10% of the image dims ) , I do not think that ensuring training with the original, uncropped image is going to make a difference.
