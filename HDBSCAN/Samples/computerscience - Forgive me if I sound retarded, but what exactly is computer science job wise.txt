Forgive me if I sound retarded, but what exactly is computer science job wise
For example, you study medicine to become a doctor, law enforcement to become a police You study computer science to become....? Software System Developer Computer Programmer Web Developer Computer Systems Engineers Software application developers App developer etc  How do I know which is right for me? How do I know that I meet the requirement for these jobs? When I get a bachelor do I automatically qualify for every computer science related job or something? Theres no clear road I dont get it T-T  submitted by /u/idkQQ1 [link] [comments]
