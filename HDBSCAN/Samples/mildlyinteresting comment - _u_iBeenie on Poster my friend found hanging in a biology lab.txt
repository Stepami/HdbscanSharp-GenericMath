/u/iBeenie on Poster my friend found hanging in a biology lab
I love my shroom trips but I think psychedelics are one of those things some people have much more fun with than others. I think if you are scared at all of doing them you're more likely to have a bad trip because you have to be really accepting of the complete change in perspective (it's not really all about the hallucinations). My boyfriend has little interest in trying them and I would never push him because I'm convinced he would have a bad trip. I've described my trips to him and he has been there with me while I was on my last one. He just doesn't seem like the type of person who wants to do that for 6+ hours (with a long and gradual comedown).
