/u/ElecNinja on Google’s actions make it more important than ever that we stand up to fight monopolies.” per Zephyr Teachout
The major issue is that becoming a monopoly basically grants you free reign over the thing you are providing and as such, there are regulations to either break up monopolies or regulate them to prevent the monopolist company from strangelling out any rising competitors. A famous tech example would be Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer being ruled again since Microsoft was using it's monopoly position as the computer os provider to prevent other web browsers from competing. Additionally, in a perfectly capitalist company, the goal is to produce capital. It is not too produce the best product. Which if an unregulated monopoly occurs, means that the company will most likely favor the capital over the product.
