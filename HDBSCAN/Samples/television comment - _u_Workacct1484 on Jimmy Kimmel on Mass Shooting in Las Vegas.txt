that darn government might come after us, after all  If Americas 2013 Gun Homicide total of 8,454 people repeated for the next 9,000 years it still would not equal the 80,900,000 people killed by their own governements during the 20th century, after they had banned guns to "protect" the citizens. Ottoman Turkey - 1.5 million Soviet Union - 20 million China - 45 million Guatemala - 100k Uganda - 300k Nazi Germany - 13 million Cambodia - 1 million  So I want people armed to be able to protect themselves. You want to implement policies which helped lead to the deaths of millions. If more death is your goal (and we already know it is as you want killers to be more proficient with their weapons) I guess that does make you rational.
