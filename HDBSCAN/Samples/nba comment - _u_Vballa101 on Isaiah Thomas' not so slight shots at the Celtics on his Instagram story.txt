/u/Vballa101 on Isaiah Thomas' not so slight shots at the Celtics on his Instagram story
I'm just trying to educate you about how negotiations work in a professional setting, because you keep spouting nonsense about them in order to make IT look bad. If you don't want to learn about the topic I won't make you, but I will point out that you are saying things that are objectively false just to shit on your former player. I genuinely hope that wasn't insulting, but you can't really expect to say things that are wrong and get upset when someone corrects you.
