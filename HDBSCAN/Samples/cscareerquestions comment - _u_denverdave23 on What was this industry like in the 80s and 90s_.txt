/u/denverdave23 on What was this industry like in the 80s and 90s?
I didn't answer your direct questions, so here goes. | Was it as trendy as it is today? Yep. Maybe more so. Java was the hot language and seen as a fad by many. I'm still a little shocked it lasted this long. Back then, it was a toy language for making applets. But, people kept on paying me to work with it. | What were interviews like? More stupidity than nowadays. We still suck at hiring, but back then we used to suck much worse. Basically, we hired anyone with a degree in compsci and could chew gum and walk. But, yeah, I did trick questions on a whiteboard more than nowadays. | Did you have to whiteboard algorithms + data structures? Actually, less than nowadays. The questions were more tricky and less based on actual coding. Believe it or not, we're in a better place now. | Was the West Coast tech company culture (lax dress code + perks) a thing, or just a few companies? Yep. The parties were epic and stupid. | Did anyone here work for a bullshit dotcom that went belly up in 2001? Novita - closed in 1996. Eazel - closed in 2001 Epicentric - closed in 2002 Eazel was the most BS. And had the best talent. They went on to be early engineers in the newly revived Apple, Danger (made the sidekick), Uber and others. Smart people who, like me, bought into the bullshit.
