/u/CentralSt on Why does it seem okay to hate Country, but not Hip-Hop?
Thank you. I see a lot of people in this thread saying that hip hop goes so much deeper than country. I love both genres, but you can't listen to one John Prine song and say that the lyrics are shallow. You can't call country bad when you're listening to save a horse ride a cowboy.
