/u/Katmobile1 on Iâ€™m Quincy Jones: gangster turned composer, record/film/TV producer, artist, arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, record co. exec., TV station owner, magazine founder, entrepreneur, humanitarian, and the dude who holds the record for most Grammy noms (79) and as many wins (27) as anyone alive. AMA!
Hi Mr Jones. My only question is this: When can I meet you? You are to me a living legend and the one person that I admire to the fullest, since you're my inspiration. Best from Stockholm!
