/u/HoboWhiz on Florida sheriff threatens arrests for fugitives who go to Hurricane Irma shelters
Lol ok, well when you're at the funeral for one of your parents, remember to imagine what it would be like at that moment to have an officer show up and take you away because you forgot to pay a speeding ticket or something. This is what this sheriff is threatening, punishment for people at their most vulnerable time instead of a helping hand.
