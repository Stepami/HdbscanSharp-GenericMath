/u/RatchetRooster on [MAIN SPOILERS] Still one of the greatest scenes
It ruins the entire scene because instead of being left to digest the scene the viewer (or at least the one who agrees with me) is taken aback by how out of place that scene was for a show of GoTs' quality. I think in a way the ending is made worse by how great the first bits are because personally I was really locked in when the part I take issue with happened. If you disagree with me that's cool just kinda was seeing if that bit bothered anyone else as much as me.
